teacher ,student,fluency You ask me a question.,So what is classification?,Medium"What is classification?
That is the best question you can ask.
The depth of question you are asking, reveals how much you have understood.
That is one mark you get.
Not one mark that goes into it.",It would be one.,MediumThat is the best question you can ask.,More I should ask you,Medium"Okay, which module is prepared well?",classification KNN.,MediumWhat is there to prepare in KNN?,So it is the first thing I read,MediumSo please tell me whether KNN is a linear classifier or non-linear classifier?,"So it is linear.
Because it is a super-wise learning technique.
We are assigning labels.
See, we have one variable.
We have other variables which have data.
So based on those, we are finding the distance to those.
We are assigning the labels of those variables to the one that we have.
The number of since it is K and N, closest number of labels, label where are they
But we have to find distance to all of them.So it is linear.
Because it is a super-wise learning technique.
",MediumSo how does that make it a linear classifier?,As we dealing with non-linear data,Medium"But I am not talking about data linearity, right?",,I am talking about classifier linearity.,,What is a linear classifier?,…....(NA),NA"These are super-wise learning, right?",….......(NA),NAWhy do you say it is a super-wise learning technique?,Because we are dealing with label data,MediumWe are dealing with label data.,,"And because it is labeled, so it is super-wise.",Yes.,NA"Okay, why?",,Why is super-wise and with label data?,"We are just, because we are assigning something that is already available.
We are not coming up with anything new.
",HighOkay.,,What are the performance metrics which can be applied for KNN classifier?,"precision , accuracy  recall , f1-score",Highwhat is Beta score,"Beta score
We have some importance.
We need to give equal importance to precision and recall
Then, you should use f 1 score with then
Beta  has one value.
So by default the value is 1.
But then when it has a different value, it becomes beta-score.
And then there's that formula for calculating",Medium"So you said when we give equal importance, beta becomes 1.",Yeah.,Medium"OK, when it decreases.",I don't know,Low"OK. You said precision and recall.
What do theymean ? Can you explain","The one is like the actual positives that are there by the total predicted positives.
And the other is the correctly predicted positives by all the positives that are there.
So this true positive, false positive, true negative, false negative is there.
So so this false negative is actually something that is positive.
And true negative is, yeah, false negative is actually something that's positive.
So we're calculating based on that.
So if you ask exactly, then precision will be true positive by true positive plus false negative.
The other one will be true positive, by true positive plus false positive.
Basically, we're checking ratios of the positivity, which we predicted by total positives and 
correct positives",Medium"What if it is a multi-class scenario?
OK. How do we carry out dimensionality reduction","PCA, TSNE, .",Medium"So, why do we do the dimensionality reduction of it?",So that we can reduce the computation but keep relevant features,HighDo they help the model?,Yes.,NA"So, you said PCA can be used for dimensional data","All three of them.
PCA, TSNE and …",MediumThen I am going to ask all three,I don't know in detail on each one.,High"So, you did PCA and it helped","So we used it in the project and so it helped
 all three.
So, it reduced dimensionality that's all.
So, we were in getting good accuracy but once we did all these three, it  gave good accuracy",MediumYour thing is regression from.,"R square, our thing  is  regression.",MediumAnd what are the metric you are using for regression?,"R square, mean absolute error, mean square, root mean square, mean percent age",High"What is the different between R square, score and that's mean absolute error","So, mean absolute error is just the difference between like the summation of 
differences between actual value minus predictive value by total number of values.
R square, we are checking something else.
So, that when it is, it ranges between 0 and 1, 1 being perfect fit.",High"Okay, is higher R square good or bad?","So, it's between 0 and 1.
And so, higher will be good.
One is the perfect fit",MediumWhat about mean absolute error?,…...(NA),NA"Mean absolute error, what kind of range of values it can take?",Sir lesser the better,Medium"Yeah, but what is the range of values it can take?",we can use..,Lowso it can take 0,If thre is no difference between natural and predicted then yeah.,High"In mean absolute error, do you have a denominator?","So, for that it should be equal to the denominator itself.
Yes, we divided by the number of values that are there",HighCan it have 1000?,yeah,NAMinus 5.,no sir only  Positive values.,Medium"So, is there a range of values mean absolute error can take?",It can't have negative value.Sure,HighPositive values it can take.,"So, in the program by some error it was coming but according to what I have learned now.
Like we are doing the projectSo, in the program by some error it was coming but according to what I have learned now.
Like we are doing the project",Medium"So, what about R square","Yeah, in this hackathon also it came sir",Medium"So, it is coming right?","yeah, ",NA"So, you are saying there is a bug in the code.",yes sir,NAThat is right is coming.,yes sir,NAAnd there is no mathematical explanation for it,no sir,NA"So, you are saying there is a bug in the code.
And there is no mathematical explanation for it",…..,What can I do to make it better,nothing sir,NAany feedback for  me,"I mean, you don’t bully like other teachers.",MediumThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA"Did you have breakfast?

It is depends on whether condition like if you want to find the weather, what is the weather condition today by using temperature?
We will use linear regression like y is equal to mx plus c like that and x will be the temperature,
 y will be the predicted weather and x will be the what is temperature of before day or something like that and we will use that",High"So, you talked about m and c. Yes.What are they?","Like when training we will get one lines by using the points which is suited for the model which has less accuracy from that.
For that plane what is the slope is called m and what is the intercept is called a.",HighWhat do they do for us?M and c.,Which is used for getting the line for the models,Medium,,"So, what does c do for the line?",Intercept like when x equal to 0 what is the height of the line from that point to Y,High,,"Yeah, but suppose let us say m as a small value versus large value.
How does the line get affected by it?","M is small value.
If m is small value the line will be till down like the line will be till down and the error 
will be increase like points is like this and we have got one line by slope.
If you decrease the slope then it will go down and the points will be where here up of the line 
 then error will be increases like we will find the mean square error like that number.
Sir, from that we will calculate the error from the line to that points and it will be increases then it will not fit for the model.",HighVery good.,,"Similarly, what is your explanation for c?",I think it will shift the line based on the x axis.,Medium You said m and c right?,It will tilt the line like this and the line position of the line moving frontward or backward will be depends on this I think,High,,Very good.,,That is right.,,So are m and c parameters or hyper parameters?,Hyper parameters. Parameters sir In the training section we will find the m and c ,HighSo they are parameters.,Yes.,NACan you name one hyper parameter for linear regression?,Hyper parameter…ah.Like for finding m and c we will find inside the training section,MediumOkay.,,Very good.,,So let us say you have built a linear regression.,yes sir,NAHow would you measure how would this regression ,"In the main thing will be I think r squares score , other things will be there like mean square error.
MAP, absolute error, mean square error, root mean square error.
Like how they will depend is like when you take points according to like distance of if points are increased,
training set will be increases, error will be increases because we are taking the root mean square summing of the points.
Then the error will be increases.
So we will take r square score.",HighWhat does r square score mean?,"Like it will be based on the RSS by TSS which depends on the predicted value and the actual value.
By taking the fraction of that like it will depend on the points like how many training data sets like that.
Like if the point is so far then I think there is condition where it will it is 1 minus RSS by TSS.
So if is point is so far then there is some points so far there is some condition like 1 minus will goes down to the 0.

by some miracle.
All right?","Metrics is used for decision trees.
But for any model we have these things, parameters called performant matrix, which tell us how accurate, 
how precise your model is working and depending on the decision tree.",Highhow will you find out whether the tree is a good tree for your purpose or not a good tree,"So, like for classification, there are accuracy, precision recall.

So, when the actual value is true and your model also predicts a true value, it is called true positive.
Sir, because they are matching.
Sir, because the model's result is in sync with the actual result.",MediumTrue you explain.,"True is coming because this true of the actual and this are tally.
And here also, sir, if actual is false and predicted is false, it is called true negative.
Because, sir, again, it both the thing is, sir, I am kind of struggling with my words, but I will explain.
Actual is false and predicted is false.
So, the outcome is false and actual and predicted are tally
No, sir, because this first true stands for if this and this match",Mediumwhy,"And negative is because the final output which is there, which it is false.",Medium"So, should not be called it as true false?","And here, the final output is true.So, that is why we use positive and we can take it.",MediumThat is true.,I have to think sir,MediumHere can you do it for a three class in scenario?,"Sir, because the value output can either be only true or false, it is binary.So, it cannot be applied with three.",MediumGive it a try.,not sure sir ,Low"how will you do it for a 3 class scenario 
So, you will say that , this does not apply for three class.
","Sir, so, in any given set of data, there are outliers, which are abnormally high or low values as compared to the rest of the data points.
So, when we have to use this data in a model, we normalize this data using various techniques like Z-score or MinMax normalization.
So, MinMax normalization is more sensitive to outliers than Z-score.
So, we use Z-score when MinMax normalization.
We use this to basically make the data to convert the data into a form which can be passed through a model.",MediumWhat is normalization of data?,"To get rid of the outliers.
We normalize the outliers into a certain bracket of range of values.
Like in MinMax normalization, we have MinMax and B maximum.
And we have a set of values from A MinMax to A maximum.
So, these A values have to be normalized in a way, such that they fit into this bracket of B values.
So, we use that formula and normalize all these.",HighBy normalization.,"Like in MinMax normalization, we have MinMax and B maximum.
That is how we are eliminating the outliers and then this data can be used
Sir, because now B has a certain range, suppose like 5 to 15.
And A, suppose has a range of 2 to 27, suppose or not.",HighI will give you an example.,Yes sir.,NA"Let us say your data is 1, 2 and 10.",Yes sir.,NA"Now, you are normalizing it to 0 to 1.","1, 2, 10.",Medium"So, do you have an outlier here?",…......,NAhow did the course go,"Sir, honestly speaking, before this course started, I was kind of skeptical about machine learning.
Because I had this impression that it is going to be a very difficult course.
Okay.
And I would even now say that it is challenging, but at the same time, it is a very interesting course.
That is why even for my next sense elective, I have chosen neural networks and deep learning.
It is very interesting how machines are made to behave like humans using artificial intelligence.
And you sir have taught us very, very well.
And I actually wanted to tell you about this evaluation pattern, sir.
You have evaluated across various formats.
Like we had a quiz, we had a hackathon, we have a viva, we have Midsemister.
So, I feel like you have been like metrics or you have been evaluating us across various metrics to.
 find out in which some people have strengths in some weaknesses and some like
I performed quite well in Midsem, but viva and confusing myself.
So, I really, really liked machine learning and I want to know more.
That is why I have chosen deep learning.
And I really enjoyed this course, I told my parents, out of my fifth semester courses, my favorite are machine learning and crypto.",Medium,,Anything I can improve about myself?,no sir,NAthank you ,thank you ,NA What is your project?,Segmentation free character recognition.,High"It is character recognition problem, a classification problem, clustering problem 
clustering problem or a regression problem.",Classifications,NAOkay.,,Is classification a supervised learning or unsupervised learning?,Supervised learning,NAWhy is it a supervised learning?,"sir  means classifications means dividing ah input into which catergory we have some multiple catergory ,
 binary , multi class and multiple like , We divide the input into which category it is 
 no sir based on which catergory we will divide it For each input, it has different characteristics.Like for one input, we will have either 0 or 1 binary.
Either it will be only those two inputs in the two classes.
For some other example, it may be in some... For example, it is a movie and it is divided into four classes horror, thriller, comedy and romance.
It will be neither one of the categories.
And multi-class means that one input may have characteristics from both.
Like if a movie is a rom-commence, it has some comedy and romance.like
Like it is divided and it has characteristics of both categories.",Medium"So, is that why it is called as a supervised learning?",Yes.,NAThat is why it is called as a supervised learning.,…........,NACan you tell me what is a unsupervised learning?,….............,NAIs clustering a supervised learning or unsupervised learning?,clustering a supervised learning.,MediumYour project deals with character recognition.,Yes sir.,NAAnd it is a classification problem.,yes sir ,NAWhat are the performance metrics used for classification?,"A performance matrix means like... We will take some inputs based on the input and output
Check it and false output and output.
Something like that will get some…",Medium"Do you know what is performance metric?
How do you measure a model that is what is performance metric deals with",I don't have that much idea sir ,Medium"How well a model is doing, you measure it, right?",with accuracy we measure it,MediumThose are called performance metrics,Yes sir,NA"So for classification, what are the performance metrics?
What is accuracy ?How do you measure it?","High accuracy  , low accuracy 
How well the trained model is doing output will take accuracy , means the if the output 
If the output is much closer to the exact output, then accuracy will be high.
And if it is far, then accuracy will be low
And how is accuracy?
I mean, this model is trained well like that to measure how well the model is trained  with the help of accuracy",High"Suppose I have 10 tomatoes and 10 oranges.
8 tomatoes are correctly classified and 7 oranges are correctly classified.
What is my accuracy?
 very good
formula is right
Now, in the example I gave of 10 tomatoes and 10 oranges
where 8 tomatoes are classified
correctly and 7 oranges are classified correctly.
Can you calculate the value of accuracy?
Can you calculate the accuracy?
And tell me what is your number?","High accuracy , It's almost doing more than 60% accuracy.
for the accuraccy , total positive plus total negative
Total means true positive plus...
True positive plus truenegative
True positive plus false positive plus false we will add those numbers ",MediumAnd... What is a distance measure?,"Distance , don’t know sir ",LowWhat are the different distances you know?,I dint study,LowHave you studied similarity?,Similarity.,NALike cosine similarity?,"I studied for midsem
Now I didn't focus that much.
I studied some regression and  knn …",Medium,,"You know what are the curses of dimensionality?
How do you reduce features?","no sir
It means if we will check whether the feature has non-violence or some empty boxes or some unrelated data.
And we'll remove those... That we clean that data.
And features also if there are some same features, same kind of data, we remove those features and keep on one feature.
",MediumHow did the course go for you?,"I mean, it was some new experience like doing hack down and... learning the chords and uploading on GitHub and practicing it.
It was some new experience for me for the first time.
It was nice.",MediumAnything I can do to improve and make it better?,"I think almost perfect.
Like giving notes on this new idea.
It's almost perfect.",Highthank you very much,Thank you  sir,NA"ok , so hat should I ask you questions from 
what does that mean , anywhere",anywhere sir ,NAwhat is diffrence between supervised and unspervised learning,"supervised learing sir it is like , you already have the set of input and we predict the output 
where as unsupervised learning is like , your inputs are not catergorised or its not stablized you just diffrentiate 
or find the similarity and predict the output 
EX - in supervised , regressor and classifior 
in unsupervised dimentionality reduction and clustering ",Highhow do you reduce dimentionality ,"by selection and feature engineering sir , we reduce the unwated columns and row 
and mainly take the which is the most important to make our model better ",Highwanted features ,most important features ,Mediumhow do you feel which are most important,"ah.. Based on your project , I am doing football prediction so mine is bsically on regression which 
uses the numerical  values continous previous match history and predicts the output
so I would prefer the match , team goal, home away team goal and the team goal which as played in far
all this features are very important , I will keep  it and I have even  classifier to predict whether it wins 
loses or draw for that I would select apart from numericals 
such as now of people present , whereis the city stadium and what are the key players and what are the 
no of injuries occuried in the pervios match ",High"ok , how do you kill missing values ","we can use mean , find the mean of the columns and fill the or you can use imputation method 
or find the mean and fill the missing values",Highand if you do that how willl that effect your model training,"it will give overfitting ,  for that we can use k4 cross validation 
we will go to the unseen data and divides the data se into k4 values 
and gives us the best performance matrix ",Highwhat is cross validation ,"cross validation is like splitting the sata into test data and training data and then you train the model 
according  to these data to find the outputs",High"ok , when you say K4 validation what does it ","divides the data into test and split that is known as K and it trains the model into k minus one .. Ah
and it gives the predicted outcome",Mediumhow do you measure the performance of a,redgression model by means square ,Medium,,can you write the formula for mean square error ,I am not able to remember sir ,Medium,,how did the course go for you ,"it went was like average only , I missed a lot of class my father had a surgery so I had to take a long leave 
there I got a lot of gap between the course ",High,,,,any feedback for me ,no sir I was not able to coupe up,Mediumthank you ,thank you sir,NAok sit down ,,What should I ask you?,what ever you want you can ask  me,Medium"Whatever you have prepared, you tell me man , I will ask you","I have seen like everything.
I have not read fully.",Medium"Okay, tell me one sequential model for classification.
SVM is  it  the sequential model.","ahh.. SVM
Sequential model for classification.
Logistic regression, SVM, K, then.
No idea, sir.",MediumDo you know what is your Markov process?,"Yes, sir",NAWhat is a Markov process?,Markov process is like determining the probability of the current state based on only on the previous state.,High"So can you give an example situation where for a classification 
the present state could actually depend on previous state?","Yes, like in text prediction task, like the current word or the next word to the current is relying on current word or the previous word,
 like to form a proper syntax or the structure of the sentence.
ahhh.. Okay.. Ah I think
In a scenario where we can say, suppose like it is about whether whether it is a cloudy rain years or not.
So depending on like past",MediumBut where is classification here?,….......,NA"And let's say you have done the classification.
There are so many classification models which you can work right.
For sequentially, you don't have lot but there are classification models for various kind of.
Now, given a problem step, how will you find out what is the best model to use?","Normally, if directly given the data set we cannot see like this model is good or that model is good.
It depends on different types of testing, measures also and sometimes it depends on size of data set also.
Like most preferable, suppose we have low data set then we can go for high bias and low variance that is like decision trees we can go.
If data set is too much large, then we can approach towards the ensemble learning techniques for class reasons like random forest.
And other measures are like only by running it, like by training the model and testing it out we can 
determine directly it is to say this model is based for this thing is not preferable.",High,,"What is bias?
You said bias and variance.",Bias is training error.,Medium,,And what is variance?,A testing error.,Medium,,Variance is testing error.,"Like variance is like how your data is spreaded.
Like depending on the data set fluctuation whether your levels fluctuate or not that is variance.",Medium,,Sure.,"Because the data set I am changing is to all levels as false.
But your level is not changing it is sticking to true.
So, it is not fluctuating with respect to data set na",High"So, if you have low bias and high variance, what does it lead to?","Low bias and high variance.
It is an overfitting case.",MediumAnd what does the overfitting mean?,"Like the machine has tried to memorize the whole the training sets whatever we give it.
It didn't learn properly rather it memorize.
So, when training a rows it will perform good.
But on testing data set it may not perform well",Medium,,Why you did not perform well on testing data set?,Because there are many factors like less training sets or not a good model for that type of scenarios or like more features compared to data set.,High,,What do you mean by more features?,"More features in the sense like the training sets should grow exponentially depending on each feature.
But the suppose you have multiple features and like increasing more dimensionality.
So, like the data set if it is less inadequate than the model may not learn properly",MediumIs it possible that you will have a different dimensionality  dimensionality?,Only the thing is like before testing the data set we need to modify the dimensionality according to the training like how we train the model.,High,,How will you modify that?,Depending on like whether we are willing to reduce the dimensionality or increase the dimensionality.,Medium,,How will you reduce dimensionality?,"In feature selection we have two methods, filter methods and wrapper methods.
And feature extraction method we have PCA, LDA
And SVD, singular value decomposition, DCT, discrete cosine transpose.
These all methods can be used for dimensionality reduction.",HighVery good.,,"And you said wrapper method.
What is wrapper method?","The wrapper method is basically like selecting the features based on the accuracy calculated.
Like whether it can provide us the better results or not.",MediumAnd is there a drawback with this method?,"Drawback can only be like we have to go for exponential search.
Like every feature we have to check it out by trying with different possible combinations.",Medium"So, it is computationally  existing ",,,Yes sir.,NAHow does normalization affect the performance of a classifier?,,,"Normalization is basically tending all the sample weights to a fixed probability.
Like contributing to like all the probability becomes one and the performance can be calculated so far easily.
In that way it can help in proper classification.
Like we have weights continuously but they are not summing all up to one sample weights.
So normalization can help remove this factor to calculate the performance.",MediumHow did the course go for you?,,,Course was well sir.,MediumAny feedback from me?,,,No sir,NAThank you.,Thank you sir.,Did you have breakfast?,No sir.,NAwhy,i dont like the upma....,Mediumwhat have you preaperd for,"sir i have prepared for classification , knn.",MediumOnly KNN.,Yes sir.,NAWhat is your project?,Project separating a bytraction sequence to answer question and answer.,HighWhat all classifier have you used?,"Classifiers .KNN, SVM ,Cad boost.",HighSo many of that.,yes sir,NAYour input data is text.,"it was audio files.
And then we converted into the text",HighBut for your system text is the required.,Yes sir.,NASo how do you classify text?,"For classifying the text, mainly use number embeddings like we number the, we label the the fee output feature what?
Firstly, we got the data, the text data, after we manually label the data.
Either it is positive negative or, sorry, statement, question sensor statement.
Then using that number is given to, for example, positive is, positive is said to one negative is 
minus one neutral was to question answer or statement.
Question is one, answer is minus one in your statement is zero.
After that embeddings are used like the TFIDF.
So it basically makes a vector using that number.
So this can be classified.",HighWhy did you use embedding?,"Because to train the model we need, we can't use directly the text values.",High,,,,What's wrong with text that you are embedding it?,"So basically the number can be, is a fixed number but text can be of, it can be a very uplindy or it can be a sort.
So it might differ, for different rows, but it will be different.
So we cannot classify which is a question which is a answer.
So basically we use numbers instead of text.",Medium"So to bring them into a standard size you are using embedding, okay.
Is classification a supervised learning or unsupervised learning?",Unsupervised learning.,NA,,Unsupervised learning.,sir Supervised.,NAWhy do you say it is unsupervised learning?,"It's because we are predicting output value based on the input values
Then in clustering we don't predict, that is unsupervised learning.
So we don't do this prediction in the clustering thing.",High"That you do everywhere, right?",….....,NA"But you predict the cluster value for a text pattern, right?",hmm..,NA"You put them into a cluster.
In classification you are putting it into a class group.
What is the difference?
Why did you choose classification?
Why not some other model for your problem?","Basically, it is a text data.
We got the data set.
We got the category data.
Mainly, we perform on classification.
We use classification.",Medium,,Why do you think classification is the right algorithm to be used for your problem?,"It means text data.
Basically, for text data, we use classification.",Medium,,What do you mean by categorical data?,….....,NAWhat are the performance metrics we use for classification?,"Accuracy ,Precision ,Recall ,F1-score
and confusion matrix",High,,What are the components of your confusion metrics?,"Components, basically, true positive, false positive, true negative, false positive",High"Suppose you have a multi-class problem.
Like you have questions and answers and statements.",3 class,NA,,how will you confusion matrix look like,"sir it will basically look like , we have 9 cell all together",Medium,,what will you call them as,"together ?
The first cell, 0, 0, it will be to prove positive.
Because the actual data is also for classes, actual true positive and predicted data for classes are so true.
So, it will be true positive.
Again, for actual data, the class A data is...
sir
ah for predicting 
It is true positive.
Again for class A, it is actually positive.",MediumVery good.,,You have any questions for me?,no sir,NA,,how did the course go for you,good sir,NAany feedback for me,no sir,NAthank you very much,thank you sir ,NAshall I start ,yes sir,NA"So, please tell me what have you prepared?","Sir, I have revised all the content which were taught before midsem
yesterday the night only I revised everything.",HighIs there a specific module you want me to ask you questions from?,"no sir, if you are asking you can go for that classification,
KNN and then Regression all those before midsem.",High,,"So, can you explain what is the pipeline for a ML project?","First we will collect data sets.
So, I will be explaining you in context of my project only.
Sure.
So, I got audio file then I converted that audio file into text, using that magazine 65.
Then I cleaned the data set.
I removed all the police talk question mark and then if we have many statements continuously then I combined all those into single statements.
After cleaning and processing all the statements I pivoted a model.
I performed in embedding first to convert that into vectorite form.
Vectorite embedding means basically converting all the object into 0 and 1 and minus 1.
We need to provide any numerical value to the particular object.
So, in our in context our project we have used minus 1, 0 and 1 for statement answer and questions structurally.
Then after doing that we have performed in each embedding we have performed 9 different models.
After evaluating model after executing code of that model we have calculated the accuracy of that model.
We have used f1 score then accuracy and that's it, sir.",Medium"Why do you think for your project classification
 is the right model to be used?","Because of classification it basically means dividing the object, dividing any row, let So, dividing object in a particular pre-defin class.
So, we have already pre-defin class and that is statement question and answer.
So, basically we choose that is why we thought classification is a little better option for that.",Medium"So, when you do decide in a given problem scenario, when you do decide whether it is a 
classification problem or it is a regression problem or it is a clustering problem, how 
will you decide that?","So, basically we need to first check whether we have a pre-defin class or not.
Like I already told you, since we have a pre-defin class in our project, but in other context, so there may be pre-defin 
class like suppose we have to predict the whether the image is of which animal.
So, we have already given a particle class may be dog, cat or cow.
So, in that case also we have a class, but what if we need to predict any mathematical 
thing like what we need to predict the sale of a particular company, what we need to predict the price of any house in a particular duration.
Suppose the price of a house today is 10,000 or what would be in next 10 years.
So, in that case we need to use regression because we prepare a model on that we train the model on the basis of price of previous few years.
On the basis of same model we predict the price of house in the coming years",Medium"Now suppose a problem statement is given to you is that emails are coming in and whether 
it is a service request or it is an inquiry or it is basically a premium payment related things.
In an insurance company you have to direct that mail into respective queues
So, what kind of how will you solve this problem?","Sir, I will go for that classification model.
Because there may be vision category.
Obviously, we may have a different classes that may be a request service request that may be related to payment also.
So, obviously we will define the pre defined class.
You will go for classification model and obviously I think as my perspective model will
look for some queues in that mail and accordingly it will classify the mail and accordingly it will send to the respective authority.Sir, I will go for that classification model.
",Medium"So, when you let us say you have built this solution and
how will you identify which is the right model to be used in this scenario?",based on accuracy model.,MediumIs accuracy a right measure or do you think some other measures can be used and why?,"To be honest, I can't tell you what exactly will be the best metric to measure the accuracy.
But I know accuracy, F1 is called precision recall.",High,,,,"So, what is the difference between accuracy and F1 score?","So, I think F1 score sir….",LowWhy which one you should prefer?,Because F1 score is combination of recall and precision that is why may be.,Medium,,why,But its just for personal opinions.,Medium,,,,"It is a combination of the recall and precision.
How does that make it any superior?",sorry sir can you go to next question ,MediumDo you know any disadvantages of using accuracy?,For regression model sir,Medium,,"Now, let's say you are dealing with a regression problem.
What matrics would you use there?","And for regression, I can use.
I will need to remember sir.
I remember sir.
And that sum square error, then mean square error, then absolute mean square error.
That's it sir.
Now, the formula are quite similar only.
So, you have to change.
In case of absolute mean to give modular sign.
And in case of route mean, you are going to give root of MSC.",Medium"So, can you use accuracy for regression problem?","Basically sir, I have not gone through this topic, but I think we can sir.",Medium,,"So, the affect of or the effect of dimensionality on a classification problem.","Sir, actually increasing dimensionality means obviously, increasing the number of feature, increasing the number of column.
So, more the number of column we have, more accuracy we get.
But it's true only until some point of time.
After some point of time, our model will get deteriorating.
Its performance will get decreasing.
And the next thing is that in case we have a larger dimensionality in our matrix,
 as a number of row in our matrix, it will get difficult for us to visualize that particular data.
And then at the same time performance of the model will also decrease.",Medium,,Why is visualizing data important?,"So, we are doing this all thing for visualization only.
Even if we are predicting the sales of the particular company, we need to visualize that 
so that we can observe how much the sale of a particular company is increasing on every year or whether it is decreasing or not or how much it is increasing.
Even if it is increasing by what context, by what to rate it, it is increasing.
So, we can observe that we can evaluate that using the visualization.",Medium"But that is a outcome you are trying to visualize.
Here you are not visualizing outcomes.
How are the input parameters which lead to the 
outcome, the visualization of input parameters important?","Sir even though there is even though you are talking only about input parameter, if you have a lot of attributes, a lot of feature.
So, obviously it will be difficult for us to evaluate because let us talk about decision tree.
We need to look for different attributes, different feature on the basis of that we will build a tree.
So, obviously if you have a lot of feature, then it will be difficult for us only to visualize.",MediumHow did the course go for you?,"to be frank sir, before starting of the semester, I was not interested in machine learning because I was only doing DSA.
But in this semester, unfortunately I could not give that much time to DSA.
But I have learnt a lot before midsem.
But after midsem, I focused on project area only.
That is my fault only I know.
And after midsem, there was just a quiz and that is all I know only.
So, I have just gone through roughly, I have just read in PPt line, what is there, but I have not concentrated on that much.",MediumAny feedback for me?,"lab evaluation can be done better , just my personal opinion ",High,,thank you ,thank you sir ,NA"Okay, so which module you have prepared well?","sir i have, prepared for starting point.",MediumWhich is the starting point?,"Supervised learning, type of machine learning , KNN, classification and evaluation matrix ",HighAny specific Supervised learning you have prepared well?,It's a KNN.,MediumWhat are the challenges when we use KNN?,"So when we use KNN, it might be like if the problem statement is too vast and if we try to do it with KNN
so it might not give us the expected output like.
And also if we take even number of the neighbors in KNN, it might get biased sometime.
And if we take more number of K's or the least number of K's, it might tend to overfit and underfit in some cases.",Medium"More or less K's can lead to overfit and underfit 
So how do you find what is the right value of K?","Yes, we can do hyper parameter tuning.",High"Hyper parameter tuning.
How do you do that?","In hyper parameter tuning, we can vary the number of K's and we can compare the testing value and training data .",HighSo that is how you will find out what is the right value of K, no sir from that  we can find if the model is over fitted or not ,High,,What is overfitting ?,"So it will give us more accuracy and training data set but very less accuracy in test data test
In overfitting  what actually happens, the model starts to memorize the state of the learning.
So it will give us more accuracy and training data set but very less accuracy in test data test",MediumSo why is that? What does that mean?,"It means that it is not learning from our data but it is starting memorizing it.
So if you test it is similar, a similar condition is there.
It will give a prediction fine but if we have new data set it might get confused.",Medium"What is most likely to happen if you are building a model to be used in a problem?
If you are trying to solve a problem,
let's say you join a job and you are trying to solve a problem.
And then your model is having overfitting.
What will be the impact of such an overfitting","sir it might not give us expected result and 
it might not give us expected result and say it will give us false results.",HighHow do you measure false results or desired results?,sir like accuracy and recall.,Medium,,What does recall mean?,"recall means sir , I cannot remember that",Medium,,You remember accuracy?,"Yes sir.
How much our model is performing well from a total ... ah?
A true positive, a true positive by all the matrix.",MediumSo why do we use this performance matrix?What is the need for that?,So performance matrix is required to evaluate our model how it is performing.,High"What are the different pre-processing steps you will
go through before you prepare your data for model training?","First of all, if I take the example, if I take an example of a project while doing K&N, 
what it was done is first all the data are converted into lower case and main info KNN, if there is a range of data, first we need to normalize it.
We will check for outliers, there is any outliers we will remove that.",HighHow do you find outliers?,boxplot,NA"So you will clear boxplot and find out outliers.
What if your data is categorical?
Can you use them for boxplot?","No sir, we can't use them.",Medium,,That's how you find outliers.,"Sir in that case, we can use many like transformers, mutual handles at cases.
Like, but it can handle missing values itself.
So like in bert, it handles missing values itself.",Medium,,"Sorry, can you explain that again?",I am the thinking.,Medium"Okay, but the question is not about missing values.",So outliers i dont have much idea.,MediumSo how did the course go for you?,,,It was so good sir.,MediumAnything I can do to improve?,,anyfeed back for me ,no sir,NA,"From starting like, it was not too fast, not too slow.
We went starting and in levels, we did everything practically.
So it was a smooth process.",MediumBut did you observe anything which can be improved?,The lab assignment was too vast for us for starting because we didn't know much ml.,HighAnything you suggest so that it can be easier for the next batch?,"Yes sir, for hackathons which was implemented.
Like it was a one day process.
So many of us, like we didn't get to implement whatever we thought.
So if it is like one week process, like there was four evaluations done.
So if it is done in four week, like first evaluation from this day to this day and everyone can come and meet two sir,",MediumBut that's something which is a very good idea.,Thank you.,NA,,thank you ,thank you sir ,NA  There are any specific module where you want me to ask you questions from?,Maybe decision tree you can try this?,Medium,,How do you construct a decision tree?,"So constructing a decision tree happens based on the output variable whatever we try to do.
And based on this output variable we will take all those independent variables which are there.
And we will check that for this independent variable the target variable whatever the values are there.
And then we will split according to the independent variables.
Suppose if it is a categorical value for example if that says about the day like sunny rainy and hot.
We will take that value split it for sunny, split it for rainy, split it for rainy.
And based on that sunny what are those output variables
And based on that we will split further if we do not get a pure split.",Mediumis decision tree a linear classifier,liner classifier in the sense sir,Mediumwhat is linear classifier ,"mostly tell if the thing is either this or that….hm
I  am not sure what linear classifier means ",Medium,,how does Class imbalance problem effects the construction of decion tree?,"Class imbalance model has a decision tree what happens is that it might cause the case of the lower class values to not get a good thing.
Or maybe it might lead to overfitting also because we do not get a pure split in terms of predicting the lower class that might become an issue.
And if the target column has more  yes than a no, that prediction will become we might get it at a very initial depth itself.
But going for the nose trying to split it where you get zero, yeses and few no's, that will cause an overfitting scenario in the decision tree.",Highokay how can we overcome that? ,"We can do pre-pruning or post-pruning by setting up the depth or max depth.
So first for post-pruning is that we make the entire tree and then based on the threshold value we start cutting off the branches.
If for pre-pruning we take the threshold and there and there itself if we check that if this threshold is not met or something so we stop going through.",High,,"can you tell me what is the principle due to which pruning hepls
in avoiding overfitting",underlying  principle ..ah something maybe related to hyper parameter like max depth,Medium,, why does that help you ever overfitting?,"So that we do not need to traverse to the end of the tree to get a pure split.
We can get at the initial two, three inches depth itself fully we can get to know about the target column.",High"So how does that help overcome overfitting?
When does overfitting happen?","Overfitting happens when there is low bias and high variance condition.
Low bias inside as the training error, less training error and the variance is the gap between the testing error and the training error",HighSo when you are doing pre-pruning what is happening to training error?,"So training error what happens is that training error in the case of overfitting also is less.
But our main aim is to actually reduce the variance so that the testing error whatever is there.
We are trying to bring that down",Medium,,So how does with pruning this brings down,"Pruning because at an initial level itself we can cut off the tree to grow more.
So if one node says that at one split if we say there are 9, yes and 2 nodes.
So we tell that at this point if we go on further the 9 just is predominant.
So we don't need to move on further.
So we will stop that splitting out from there and we will tell that at this point of level
 if any node by chance reaches this level we will categorize that as a yes.
Okay, you are asking like how does this help reduce the testing error?",Medium,"So if one node says that at one split if we say there are 9, yes and 2 nodes.",High,So we tell that at this point if we go on further the 9 just is predominant.,High,So we don't need to move on further.,Medium,So we will stop that splitting out from there and we will tell that at this point of level,High, if any node by chance reaches this level we will categorize that as a yes.,High,"Okay, you are asking like how does this help reduce the testing error?",High,,That is what is pruning,I have no idea. Sir maybe I can think about it,MediumHow does this help reduce the variance?,"Okay, variance.
Hmm.
Because there is testing error.
I have no idea.
Maybe I might think of it but not having that concrete on certain.
Well, testing error.
It is to me that can only be decreased with the tree leaving the variance.
Pruning on the low self and reducing the level of the tree.
It will decrease that level of the tree.
How does that help  in testing error
No, sir. I have no Idea
That is more difficult.
Maybe I can do it",MediumYou can?,,Okay.,,You do.,Hmm.,NAHow much time will you talk to me and answer?,"Yeah.
Testing.
No sir.
No.
No, no.
I am trying but I am not refining that.",LowWhat can you find?,"Some relation may be like a test input that has been passed on to a decision tree.
Hmm.
But I can only get to know that if you prune it so we don't go into the depth of the tree.
And that will become helpful to get an output variable in an easier manner.
That's how maybe pruning works and does not help.",MediumYou can use help if you want.,what Helps sir,NA,,Whatever help you want.,From where?,NAWhatever you want.,don't know sir.,NAWhat is the difference between minmax normalization and Zsquare normalization?,"Minmax normalization converts the given set of output variable to a set set of output like if it is not determined by me.
That output, if the current thing is there, if you have to convert that into a particular range to say.
So then we use minmax normalization.
But when we have to convert this given output variable in terms of 0 to 1 range, then we use something called as Z square
For the mean that Z square normalization, the mean I guess it becomes to 0 and the standard deviation I am not sure about it.",HighWhat happens to the mean and variance of the data after Z square normalization?,"Mean, maybe.",NAThat it becomes 0?,"Um, Z Sqaure…",NACan you prove it?,"No, sorry, I can't prove it.",Medium,,How did the course go for you?,"Good sir,",NA,,what was good.,"The way of teaching, the way of understanding everything, like the way in which the labs were set, like we had to do everything.
So that made us go into more areas of discovering it by ourselves.
Instead of other labs where we were set to do this particular thing and we were given a course to do.
We also here, when saw through one of the lab exercises, then we thought, okay, if this is happening, what would be the next step of that?
So that really helped this.
And machine learning, which was a taboo for me before I thought machine learning is something which is very hard 
or something while coming out it understood that we are going through this object, I found out that, okay, it's fine.
It's not what I thought it was, that horrific.",HighAnd you can give feedback for me.,"Ah, feedback in the sense, nothing everything is good.
There's nothing to point out once like this.",MediumThank you very much.,Thank you.,NAwhat  have you prepared for the viva,"I have  prepared ,I have covered everything but perfectly I can tell till midsem.",High,,What is the difference between clustering and classification?,"Classification is when we have to differentiate between two particular things, if it is binary,
 I am considering binary, two different things where you have to separate between the features, then we use classification.
Clustering is when we have to form different groups which have the same properties.
Now let us say we have 10 data points and we have to tell like how similar are they, 
then we can tell that okay this 4 belongs to 1 cluster, this 6 belongs to 1 cluster based on the similar properties.
Whereas if we take the same 10 data points in classification, we have to tell it like this belongs to this class.",High,,So in clustering you say this belongs to this cluster in clustering.,"No, in clustering you tell that you make coherent groups of the data points instead of telling 
that in classification you tell that this data point has this kind of properties.
In clustering you tell that this data point like matches with this data points and
 how coherent are they and you make it into that 1 cluster.",HighSo is any of them a supervised learning?,"Yeah, classification is a supervised learning and clustering is an unsupervised learning.",High,,why ,"In clustering, classification we have a label telling the model that like it belongs to this or it belongs to that.
Whereas in clustering we do not have any such labels telling we do not giving any information
 before to the data based on the data the model itself is learning on its own and then based on that it is forming the clusters.
Whereas in classification we are giving the data like this is the label",MediumJust because you give label it becomes supervised.,"No, we are giving some like a guidance kind of thing before only saying that",High,,"What is the use of that guidance? 
Does the algorithm use it?","Yeah, based on the data points it will now let's take classification based on the data points. Lets take K-NN
If it is a certain distance and it will tell that this distance belongs to this class and 
it comes to the test case based on that model that label we give and what it learned with that values of data points.
It is nearest it will classify it to that data point itself.
So based on the label that we give only it is learning and then it is putting the new test case and 
that whereas in clustering in unsupervised learning we do not have a label.
So we are not telling it belongs to something.
We are not giving any initial guidance to the model it is learning on its own telling that
 this group data points are closely related to each other and not everything is not matching to one thing.",MediumSo how do you measure the performance of a clustering algorithm?,"We have three metrics and there are more than three but the major three are the silhouette and DB index and C-H index.
Silver quotient what it basically does is it will tell okay first tell from DB index.
So DB index tells the average similarity ratio of this closest cluster to the similar cluster.
So it is like the DB index value for a model should be less which means that it is a better cluster.
It means that the cluster is similar to itself more than like a cluster point it is similar to itself compared to the other cluster.
Similarity.
And then C-H index is ratio between clusters to within the cluster.
So the more the C-H index the better the model is.
So it is like let us say we have three different two different clusters and if we take the data points should be less distance.
 of this cluster and the average distance between this and this if we take it should be more more and then the within the cluster
So it means that the clusters are compact.
Then, silhouette I have a little doubt let me think for a while.
silhouette is like the how date how much is the data point similar to its own cluster compared to the other clusters.
Now for example let us say we have two clusters and we will take the first cluster and one data point of that cluster.
How similar is it to that cluster compared to the some other data point of that cluster.
So this silhouette question fails in case of like the uneven data distributions like how should we manage the tutorials or when it is like this.
So and there is one more cluster then this cluster will be close to this point compared to the other end of the same its own cluster.
So in that case silhouette question fails but then other others will come in.",Medium,,Suppose you have missing values in your data.How do you fill the data?,"We perform data imputation it depends on what kind of the data it is.
So first if you have categorical data we can use more to fill up the missing values.
And next if it is numerical data like quantitative data and if there are outliers that is better to go with median as mean is very sensitive to the outliers.
And if there are no outliers and the data distribution is balanced then we can go with the mean value and impute the data.
And if there is more than like 50 to 60% of the values missing then it is better not impute because it will affect.",Medium"Now suppose you do imputation of data with central tendencies.
How will it affect the clustering?","Assuming the data is quantitative and there are no outliars and then we can impute it with the mean value.
So when we impute the data of the mean value so now let us say 20% of the values are missing and
 the 20% of the values in the data will become the mean value.
So when we do clustering there is a high chance that there is no proper separability 
between the clusters and also each clusters are not that compact.Assuming the data is quantitative and there are no outliars and then we can impute it with the mean value.
So when we impute the data of the mean value so now let us say 20% of the values are missing and

between the clusters and also each clusters are not that compact.",Medium"what is the impact of dimensionality reduction, on classification.
Suppose you have low dimensional data versus  
high dimensional data which is good for classification and why?","I think both of them have their own advantages and disadvantages.
When we take low dimensionality then there is a high chance that the models are not getting all the patterns of the data.
But when we have too high there is a high chance of overfitting also especially considering classification like decision trees.
When there is a lot of features and if we do not do pruning for the decision tree and then there is a high chance of overfitting also.
So I think it is better to moderate the dimensionality in order that the model is
 capable of getting the underlying patterns and also not going to that extent of the overfitting",Highany questions for me ,how did I do ?,Mediumyou also know,,any feed back  for me ,this is the best course I have taken and only course I have learnt something without depending on chat gpt  or youtube,High,,anything I can do to improve ,no sir ,NA,,thank you very much,thank you very much,NA"So, what have you prepared?",I have prepared Everything.,Medium,,Everything ?,Yes sir.,NA,,Where do you want me to start?,at the start … inaudible,Low,,What is high-dimensional data?,Data with many attributes.,Medium,,What are the problems of high-dimensional data?,"It is like computationally costly to use high-dimensional data.
Also, there might be many features which are not required.
Also, if the dimensionality uses accuracy also might reduce.",MediumHow do we construct decision tree?,"Decision-tree will use the attributes and see if the attribute has this value.
How many observations will be there for this and how many observations will not be there for the other value.
So, we will use an attribute and divide the, if we have total 10 observations, we will divide that into how many other values are there.",HighAre you sure what you are telling?,Yes sir.,NA,,"can you explain , maybe take a example and explain","So, if we have data with a hair length, gender is the class, the dependent variable, hair length, something.
If they are a ring or not, so if we use one of the attributes, say, if they have ring or not, and 
if one of the values is yes and one is no, we will divide using that.
And if we have like five boys and six girls who have, yes, ring, who have ring,
 then the membership of this node will be five boys and six girls.
And using that will calculate the entropy.
And to select which attribute will be used for the decision-try making, we will see how much entropy is reduced.
The one which reduces the entropy to the maximum is used for the division.",MediumHow do you know when to stop?,"When to stop, if we have, we reach the entropy as zero, then we stop.
Or else, if the size is like too much, we use pruning techniques to stop.
And using technique to stop.",HighOkay.,,how ,"We have two pruning techniques, post pruning and pre-pre pruning.
We use threshold values like, if entropy is reaching this point, we will stop.
Or else, if these many divisions are done, we will stop.
We will use either of that and we will stop.
Post pruning is, after the tree grows completely, we will cut the tree at the threshold point.
Or else, pre-pruning is, we will stop the tree when the threshold is reached.",MediumHow is dimensionality affecting this is decision tree construction?,"So, if we have more attributes, then we have a very big tree.
If the tree grows on increasing, it will affect like overfitting might happen.",,,,,"So, you are saying overfitting happens when you have high dimensional data?","No, the length of size of the tree increases.",Medium,,"So, you will have high dimensional data yet the size will not increase.How","If we select the features correctly, then the size of the tree might not increase.",High,,How do you select features correctly?,Which give the maximum information gain?,Medium"So, what stops you from selecting features which are giving maximum information?
That you do always, right?
So, then why does the tree go overfitting?","If we like, even if we get maximum information gain, we might not reach zero entropy.
So, if we might check for all the attributes and we will get a tree length equal to the size of attributes.
Then, information gain is to check to use the maximum, which reduces the entropy most at this particular step.
But not all the attributes might give good information gain and
 we might need to use all the attributes to reach a good entropy difference.
So, we might need an entire, like, all attributes and we might construct a bit.",MediumDoes high dimensional data affect construction of this decision tree or not?,"Like, mainly it will affect the cost of the building of the tree.
If features are all, like, less important, then it will affect it more.
But if some features are there, which are contributing more to the finding of the output variable, then it does not affect much.
So, we will need only some attributes and the construct a tree of small size.",High"So, suppose you are doing normalization of data.
Which technique will you add up?","We have two normalizations, minmax and z-square.",MediumAnd how would that affect your decision tree construction?,"So, if my data has many outliers and I will use z-square and if I want my data to be,
 like, in this particular range, then I will use minmax normalization.",Medium,,,,"It won't impact much or it won't impact or it will impact greatly.
Which one is better?","Not sure.
So, if we will do scaling also, we will do bending and then find the decision tree.
So, I don't think it will affect much.",MediumOkay.,,Why do you say it won't impact?,It won't impact.,NA,,,,"That you have already said ,question is why?","Because, like, if we are having some 1 to 100 values, like, for particular feature, if we do normalization, it won't impact.
But, if we are doing normalization because there are, it won't impact.
So, if we have 1 to 100 and it is scaled, with minmax, we are doing it to 1 to 10.
It doesn't matter.
So, like, we will take that binning techniques and we will divide the first half into this first, second half into the other part of the branch.
If we do z sqaure-normalization also, if mean is fired something, we will get some 3 to 7 or something.
Then also, we will do binning and first part of the data will stay in the first half only.
Second part of the data will stay in the second half only.
So, it won't affect.",MediumWhat is the distance metric and what is the similarity metric?,"Distance metric is from a particular observation point.
What is the distance of from in a space where we use the attributes as the axis and create

But adding, what I know clearly is adding some amount of data which is not dimensionality obviously, 
will not result in so much difference, but I am not sure about dimensionality.",Medium"So, what will you do if you have high variance low bias and the variance is high?
If you have got high variance low bias, leading to variance being high, what will you do?","High variance then I will open multiple sub, my more subsets, more subsets, that is how we solve the problem of division tree.
Now, after getting more number of, and each, each will be an expertise, each data, each division tree will be expertise on that sub current subset only.
So, even if I have more, so this process of splitting it and becoming a experience on the same thing and then aggregating will result in lower variance.
How in such, we are prone to less overfitting.",High,,how?,"how?....
We see data in more ways.
It is not only from one direction, we see it from all, there can be repeating values in all of this.
So, we see it in, you know, not in such a standard way, its combination of, yeah, this might be, if that might be.
So, it will result in more better robust, pretty good.",MediumWhat is the Normalization of data?,"If we have data which is not well fitting, not generalizing with our current data, so we normalize the data to make it better fit generalizing to our data set.
Process of decreasing our outliners",High"So, if there are no outliers in the data, you can normalize it.","It will just make a, it depends on what you do, it will just, if no outliners you do not have to know.
You can continue on the same data set, or if you have any condition like one data, one data is very,
 in one lakhs, like think the platelets of someone is in one lakhs and then the age is like 50.
So, in this case, again you will have to do it, because this will just overshadow whatever age condition is like it.
So, at that time also you can get this to equalize this and so this age will also have a weight,
some amount of decision making while splitting the data",High"So, you are saying normalization helps to overcome outliners",Yes.,NA"Can you help me understand how?
 but how does it get rid of outliers?","Just as I told
We like the whole data we can divide by 10,000 of this same thing and then it becomes",High,,,," even in division by 10,000 outliers remains outlier.","It gets into a smaller range, so I think that helps",Medium,,"Whatever you mean to say that outliers do not exist, if smaller range is there.","They do exist.
Then it better helps with the data set.
Let us say, either if it is, there is mean mode.
So, if there is a data which is very high and not then like we have 20, 30 and it is all between this 20, 30 range and then we have something which is 90.
So, now when we do this and there is no such, it might, this 90, when we take mean of all of this, then it will affect a lot of this.
But then if we convert this into everything we divide by, that means, formulas we use and get it in a smaller range, I think it will be more processable.",MediumIs it affecting construction of decision tree?,"Construction of the, yeah, it will affect.
Decision tree also we have our normal data, classifying data, regression data.
So, there also if there is some outlier then we have to use, we will use this and then do our decision tree.
It is a very good first step for any data set.",High,,does it affect construction of decision tree?,"I think median will be a best choice for this as, for classification side in regression side .
we take mode because if it is good, good, good, good and very good
So, we say, yeah, good is a better choice to fill in the particular place.
These do matter in the starting stage before you execute the whole decision tree",HighHow did the course go for you?,"Course was nicer, it was good learning, it was not only sit paper, like more on hand, that was nice.
Hackathon also was great.
We did a lot in those few hours, learnt a lot also.
It was and we learnt a lot because we did in our projects most of the things.
So, we could implement it faster in the hackathon.
That was nice.",HighAnd if any feedback for me.,"No sir, it was a very good all sessions.",MediumThank you very much.,thank you very much,NA,,NA What is your project?,"So my project is regarding segmentation free character recognition system based on deep learning approach.
Deep learning approach.",High"So this character recognition is that a classification problem
 problem or regression or what kind of problem it is?","It is like classification , like we are recognising text from images
Because we are predicting the necessary like the character from the images from the test training data.",Highwhy do you think its classification problem ,So we are predicting into a particular character based on whatever training data we are having.,High"And what do you do let us say in clustering or in regression?
Don't you do the same thing?","So in regression it is based on continuous values.
We are based on continuous values and in clustering we group the similar data points in a particular cluster.
In clustering we do not have any training data set.
So it is like unsupervised learning.
So based on the properties which each feature like observation has we are clustering it into groups.
Whereas in classification we have some training data.
So based on the training set we predict it to which label it goes.
The value is where it is.",MediumSo what are the different performance matric we use for classification?,"For classification we use accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score",High"Why we have four different measures?
Why not just one?","So actually we are calculating how properly a model predicts the actual values and 
how true the values from the actual and the prediction predicted by the model.
So each performance metric tells about like one one information of what is the trueness of a particular like.",High,,Why not? But wouldn't it cost confusion?,hm,NASo for instead of giving you one grade in the end of the subject.,Like the four different grades are not based on the same metric.,HighIf I give you four different grades.,Different metrics.,NA,,So now how will you know whether you have passed or failed ,based on the average of all these grades,Medium,,"Then we could have, as well take the average of the four things and then put it as one number.
Why are we having so many numbers?
You understood my problem.","Like according to me what I feel is each performance metric tells about one minute information.
It's not all the four are not giving the same information.",High"But the question is should we have four different things?
What is required?",that is required no sir,Medium"In all the respective angles we are checking.
You said that they are given different information.
Can you tell me what different information let's say accuracy and precision,
 what different information do they give?",….............,NAThat is the formula.,For example when we take the formula accuracy it is true positive plus true negative by it.,HighAnd the same that is in my opinion you are just manipulating words.,"And the precision and recall if we take it is true positive, true positive is false positive.",HighIt is a number.,And accuracy we are checking how the model is correctly classifying a particular case.,HighWhat does it tell me?,For example true positive and true negatives are it is actually true and the model also has predicted it true.,High"Suppose I say that pass mark in your subject in my subject is 40 marks and you have got 53.
So what does it mean to you?",I have passed,NADo you tell that okay this 53 came from quiz mid-same all these things you don't say that,finally I tell iam passed,Medium"So that's exactly it tell me what does it mean?
What does accuracy mean and what does precision mean?
How are the meaning different things?",…..........,NA"You have to know what that means if you can't define it and just get off 
at've meant your sentence together from the beginning or you felt it.",I am not getting sir how to tell it ,Medium,,"Now tell me how do you know whether 2 vectors are independent of each other or not?
How?
How does  cosine tell you if the vectors are independent or not?
if value is zero its independent
you  are sure about it",sir we use cosine similarity,Medium"And you are sure about it.
It is dependent.
Then how do you know if they are independent?",like if value 0 its independent,MediumIt is dependent.,….......,NAThen how do you know if they are independent?,"Like if the value is 0 it is independent.
One second.",Medium,,Can you write the formula or covariance?,I don’t know,NACan you write the formula for entropy?,yes sir,NA,,Can you tell me what is this pk?,"pk is the probability sir.
For example, in the decision tree when we take, when we classify each feature as s or no.
So, the probability of  yes factor in probability of no factor.
Like can I say an example?",HighYes.,"For example, we are trying to predict will it train or not?
So, that is going to be the root node.
So, from that root node like based on the features which we are considering, we will have a particular prediction.
So, based on that yes and no.
Whether it is going to rain based on what features we are considering.
If the label corresponding to it is having s or no, we choose that how many  yes and 
how many nodes we classify then further nodes, child nodes will emerge from the root node.",Medium"That is where you use this question is what does that pk mean?
How do you calculate occurrence of particular event?
What does that mean in a classification problem?
You said you will take an example and explain.
Take a classification example and explain.
You are doing character classification.
So, let us say you have 50 character classes.
So, what would pk mean there?
You have features for 50 character classes.
Those are there for like let us say 10 samples from each class.
So, you have 500 samples.
You have features from that, feature vectors.
So, let us say feature vector is 10 dimensional.
So, you have 510 dimensional vectors within the level of the class.
Right?
Now tell me what is pk?",,How do you calculate pk here?,"The total number of for example, if the label is finite classification we take sn.
The total number of s divided by the total number of like 500 samples whatever is there that is value
For example, for 500, 250 yes and 250 no",Medium"What your character of a classification is about is not it?
What am I missing?","So, multiple classes are there.
you have multiple class then you will have.. Ah
if you consider one class that one class will have
take all the rows pertainig to it divided by  total no of rows to particular label",Medium"Okay, how did that course go for you?",fine sir,NAAnd any feedback for me?,nothing sir,NAThank you very much.,thank you sir,NA"tell me whats binning , equal width binning",i am not sure,NAequal frequency meaning, so i think when the frequency is not sure honestly,Mediumokay no equal width  binning no equal frequency binning okay alright how do you feel missing values," sir using mean, median or mode",Mediumwhat is encoding,"encoding is a technique there are two types of encoding one hot encoding and label encoding to convert 
the label values into binary or like to convert categorical data into numerical data we will use encoding",High by doing that what happens,"we can for the ML model let this easier to understand category numerical data so we convert numerical data 
into categorical data into numerical data like if i have three classes or four classes 
i can make it into one two three four and i can index it up",High,,do you get some drawbacks in the process of this,sir maybe i don't think so i don't think so we will be in it it does to make the code better ,Highso it is always good ,it is mostly,NAso when it is not good,"when the number of categories and few categories have very less amount in 
few others have very large frequency then not good",Highwhy it is not good ,because the numerical data is repeated multiple number of times so the max-min independent on that particular category,High,,how does it affect training of your model ,"so it is something like the model is overloaded or overfitted with a particular category 
so the output may be varied on i mean it would be biased towards that",High you said overfit what is overfit,"number of branches are too many then it is called as overfit
 no i am not able to put it up",Mediumin the tree the number of branches are too many it is  called overfit,i think normalization can be one way of providing normalization can help avoid overfitting,High,, okay so how do we do how do we avoid overfitting or what is the cause of overfitting ,sir k is the number of branches and it is very good sir k is the number of elements and number of points in the cluster ,High,,"okay right you said that you have studied KNN  very good what is k 
when does the overfitting happen in k
okay tell me how is the amalization affecting k and n performance "," when all the I mean clusters are not clusters but the distance I mean the distance are very close if k value is 3 
I can take 3 of the elements but fourth is also very close by and 2 is having higher frequency 
then 2 is having higher frequency then i mean i am not clear about overfitting
for example i take a data of a hospital data and the amount of white plate cells are in lakhs and the BP for example is in 2 or 3 digits
if i take the spo  level it is in 2  digits so this concept is like when i take a ecludiean or if i try to understand
 it what happens is the white blood cells affect the data set or affect the model more and it is more biased towards white plate cells 
and it is very less biased towards this one the BP of the spo2 to level is not having that much and that is why we try normalizing
 it and then knn when i do that i don't understand which factor is affecting or which parameter is affecting the particular label
 more like how do i put it so in case i have orange and apple as two categories and according to size one component 
and color one component because color is encoded and size is not or color i am giving a value size plays more important role
 than color so in that case if anything that is peaked that might be called apple and 
other might be called orange even if the color doesn't make a difference in the normalization effect KNN",Highwhat is entropy?,"the change  towards decision tree

That I will not do.
But so... What do you want me to ask you from midsem?",,"lets deal with KNN
what is KNN","Classification, KNN classifier",LowHow do you know what is K?,"So it's the number of observations that you consider to find the majority class.
So I think it depends...
I think K, you have to decide based on like matrix.
Okay, I think that's class.
So I think you have to apply different values of K and then decide which is the best based on the result that you're getting.
So for example, if you take K is equal to 1, then you're only considering one observation that's nearest to the test observation.
But if you're taking K is equal to 3 or 5, then you'll consider a higher number of observations to compare.
And then based on the majority of the level, then you'll decide which level the test observation should go to.",MediumWhat is your overfitting?,"So, overfitting is when a model becomes dependent on the training data.
When it becomes too used to the training data, the patterns that it finds in the training data.
When you introduce it to new data sets, then it won't be able to handle it.
Because it becomes very dependent on the training data.
This is overfitting.",MediumWhen does overfitting happen in KNN?,Overfitting in KNN…ah,Low"Okay, how do you detect overfitting is happening or not?","When the model performs very well on the training data, but it's not able to perform the same way in testing data.",HighWhat does it mean?,It means that the model became too dependent on the training data,HighWhat does performing well performing not well mean?,"So, based on error, I think.
Yes
Bias and variance",MediumBias and variance.,Maybe when the class that the test observation is put into is the wrong class,High"We jump to the stones and come back.
When does K and N go for overfitting?
Each observation will either go to a right class or to a wrong class.
So, one sample to another sample, you are overfitting, now overfitting, we'll keep jumping around.","So, I think you have an idea of which class the test observation is supposed to go to.
I think if it doesn't go to that class, then the model is wrong
",High"So, let's say I have taken 100 samples, test observations.
70 of them go to their respective classes, 30 don't go.
So, would I say 70 times the model was not overfitting and 30 times it will go overfitting?","hm
I think that time you will be like 70 percent,
the model is performing well, 30 percent is not performing well.
",MediumQuestion is is it overfitting or not how do I do it?,No.Not sure ,NA"You said bias and variance.
What is bias?","Bias is the non-zero value of an error
Whenever our error is non-zero, the error value is your bias.
And variance is the difference between two errors",HighWhat does that mean?,Any two errors in your class?,MediumWhich two errors?,I think so,NA"Out of 100 samples.
I will just randomly pick two samples and find out whether their error is there or not",You have to encode it to numerical data.,Medium,,"So, just say you have categorical data
how will you use it in KNN","Label and coding are one hot encoding
After doing encoding of categorical data, we will be transformed into numerical data.
After that, if you do KNN classification, then the test observation will be classified  accordingly",High"And how do you know
Label   encoding are one hot and coding.
Once you know either level or one hot, how do they affect it?",I don't think it will affect.,Medium,,"Right or not?
How about dimensionality?
What are the problems of high-dimensionality?","When there is high-dimensionality, it means that there is a lot of features in your data set.
The model may not be able to perform as well.
If you reduce the dimensionality, then the number of features will get compact.
Basically, you reduce the dimensionality, trying to retain as much as the information as possible.
So the model will be able to perform more efficiently with the maximum amount of information that it can get",HighHow does it affect KNN,I think higher dimensionality will be harder for the classifier to process,High,,And why do you think like that?,"Because it's more amount of data to consider.
So the model will definitely find it hard to go through the end of the process.
It's more amount of data.",High,,"So how do you think the model will get higher and stop
Will it take more time to process?","No, it will take more time.
Process it 
I will use PCA",Medium"Okay, so what should I do?
I don't want to increase time
So what should I do?","So through, so basically PCA considers something called variance.
It tries to retain as much variance as possible.
It will create different components.
The first component will go for the data that has the most variance.
So it goes accordingly.",High"Now we have come to my favorite question.
Please explain how PCA reduces time and subject","It will create different components and it will try to retain as much information as possible.
It will try to maintain the maximum amount of variance that it can.
And it will remove the unnecessary data",High"How does it decide which is necessary, which is unnecessary?","As far as the variance, based on how much of a variance that the data has",High"Suppose I want to retain 100% variance.
Will PCA be able to reduce the immense amount","No, so I don't think so.",Mediumconfident,"yes,I think
I think 99% variance then it can bring it up.",MediumI am talking about 100%,"Sure.
Yes.

Okay then what could be a classification problem?","Like when we get, we will get the output, categorical output.
Based on like if we a person is suffering from cancer based on.
Like we are predicting yes or know.
Yes or no like categorical.",Medium"If you are predicting categorical values.
And here you are predicting what in a correct categorial problem?",Text.,NA,,You are predicting text,yes sir ,NA,,So is that a continuous variable or a categorical?,Categorial,NA,,And each classification is supervised learning or on supervised learning?,Supervised learning.,NA,,Why?,"Why…
Like maps that excel way, with product of x and y.
Like the features are mapping with excel way.
And that is supervised learning.
That is a classification because in both.
Like if you are predicting output from the input characteristics.",MediumSo what are the performance metrics we can use for classification?,"Accuracy, F1 score, appreciation, the current",High,,Which one should you use for your problem?,Use F1 score accuracy,Medium"Can you tell me what is the problem with accuracy?
as a measure?","What is the problem with accuracy
….......dont know sir ",LowHow do you feel missing values of data?,"Like if you want to, like, their methods, sir.
We could take one random value and we  fill the missing values with the same number.
Or if you find the mean or like, mean or median, those, what do you say?
That mean or median, more than things.
And we will fill those missing values, the things",Medium"Mean, median and mode.
What are they?",That means statistical measures.,Medium"Like, what is your explanation for that?","Like, we find the mean for all the things.",Medium"So, if you fill things by mean value, why do you have a median and a more?
What do they do?",For which it is performing  good.,Medium"How will you know for which it will perform good?
so what will you do","We, I think most of the people will fill the missing values with some random number.
If the missing value percentage is greater than 60.
We will remove that attribute.
If it is less than 60, we will…",High"what is a missing value.
What do you mean by missing value  less than 60?",And then we will remove that attribute,Medium,,"Who asked you to remove it?
That is not your design.","So, I want to keep that.
I will fill some random numbers.
Some random number for all the missing values",MediumWhat is high-dimensional data and what are the problems with it?,"Sometimes, if you have dimensions, like some dimensions, the model doesn't know where it is at.
Dimension that thing is called dimension.
If it is greater than greater value, the independent of the dimension it takes the value as higher.
If it is lower, the independent of the dimension it takes a lower value.",HighHow did the course go for you?,Good.,NAWhy it goes good?,"Because this is... Like, no, ML is good.
Before this... Like, we got some...idea
how we will build some models.
How ML works.",Mediumany feedback for me ,no sir ,NAthank you very much,thank you sir,NASo tell me where should I start?,classification sir ….(silently ),Lowsorry ,Classification sir ,NA"classification ok
is  there any specific classifier ",KNN,NAWhat is K?,"K. It is used for optimal number of, like, K distance.",MediumHopefully it doesn't reach the point where you say K is my girlfriend's name.,"No, sir.",NA,,So what is K?,"K is used for, I mean, if K is equal to 3, we will say, first three.
Nearest three.",MediumWhat is the minimum value of K?,1 ….,NANot 0.,0…,NAWhy not minus?,"no no no…
Like the data sets start from 0.
If there are no data, so it will be 0 maybe.",Low"If there is no data, so your K value depends on the data.
How?",We will arrange it according to distances.,MediumAnd what is the maximum value of K?,number of rows of data.,Medium"Suppose you take K equal to the number of rows of data.
What will happen?","The computational power will increase.
It will take more time and maybe.",MediumWhy you should take more time?,"Like, data set has more rows.
It takes until, it has 1000 rows.
It takes 1000 rows.
We have to check 1000 rows.
They have to check for 1000 rows.
But the distance is, we have to calculate.
We have to arrange it according to the distances.
And then, yeah.",Medium"So, if the data set has 1000 rows and K equal to 1000,
you will calculate 1000 distances.","Oh, yes.",NA"That is why it is computationally intensive.
Now, suppose the data set has 1000 rows.
Rows and K is equal to 3.
You calculate less distance.","Then also, I will take calculate everything.",MediumHow is K large becoming a problem?,It is not a problem,MediumIs there any advantage of taking a large value of K?,Don't know.,NA,,"So, variation of K neither creates a problem nor creates any advantage.",,"So, you can take any value of K","Oh, no. sir",NAothers are not optimal,"there may be optimal K.
Only one value will be optimal.

If it is voice data, K should be high.
If it is girl's data, K should be low.
Is that like that?","No, sir.
Different values of K, different accuracy will come.
Which will give best accuracy.
Then, it will be that.",MediumHow many different accuracy will you know?,0 to 100%.,NACan accuracy go below 0%.,No.,NACan accuracy go beyond 100%.,No.,NAWhat is the desirable value of accuracy?,"Desire of K.

Why that word hot is there?",don’t know sir,NAWhat is the difference between one hot encoding and a label encoding?,"Labeling encoding is for labeling.
One heart is for numeric.",Medium"One heart is for numeric?
And label?",Labeling is for categorical label encoding.,Medium,,"Very good.

can you close the door please ","sir classification 
in that , I have too..ah or I can select sir ,
KNN classification sir ",MediumKNN ? Why KNN ,I think I have studied some detail about kNN ,MediumOk tell me how Knn works ,"basically  we find the ecludian distance for the target observation 
and all the observation in the data set and we will sort that distances
based on the K value we see the highest voting of the classifier like which class highest voting
and we will assign that target class to target observation ",Highwhich class you will do voting ,"which class , among if  I have selected if K equal to 3 
if two class  has class ha blue another has red
so the highest class is blue , so I will assign the  target observation to blue class",High,,"tell me one advantage and one 
disadvantage of this algorithm ","1 disadvantage is we have to find the optimal value of K 
otherwise if I select K value as even no like 4 
2 classes have class like blue other 2 have  orange then there will confusion like 
which class should we assign ",Higheasy for whom ,and 1 advantage is ahh … it is easy to calculate the distance by ecludian diatance ..,Mediumeasy for you or machine,"…for me .. For us .. No for machine it is difficult is data set is large 
if data  set is small for machine it is easy ",Mediumis it advantage or disadvantage ,"disadvantage , sorry sirr….",Lowso what is the advantage ,….there are so many disadvantages sir ,Lowok  so tell me few more disadvantage,"like I said if it is a large data it will take lot of time to calculate the distances

and we have to find the optimal valye of K or it will be difficult ",High"ok lets say we have high dimensional data lot of
features are there ",haa,NAis good or  is it bad,it is bad sir ,NAwhat are the difficulties it form,"if there are more dimension it will be difficult visualize the graph for the 
dimension and also take computational complexity , more time and also overfitting may happen",Highwhy would high dimensionality  may lead to overfiting,"….if there are more dimension it will be difficult to visualize 
if it is 2 dimension we can visualize easily we will get a line , 3 dimension 
also It will be easy 
if it exceeds more than 3 dimension it difficlut to visualize , to understand",Mediumso because it is difficult to undersand it is overfiiting ,not only that..computational complexity will be more and also more time ….,Mediumokay tell me what is overfitting,in overfitting .. Ah there will be more bias low variance,Medium"what is bias , what is variance",ahh… error in data set ,Lowwhat do you mean by error in data set,"varience is like there will be more difference in value like if we select 
like 1,2,3,5  like other 10 there will be more diffrence ",High"what ever you explained about variance and bias
can you explain how they mean anything about overfitting",if there is more bias and less variance it leads to overfitting ,High"then how should the data be 
for low bias and low variance ",we can reduce the dimension.. All that,Mediumhow can you reduce dimension ,"dimensionality reduction we can use feature selection or transformation technique 
in filter selction we can use information gain or we assign weight to the dimensions

So this is linear.
The point is the surrounding point then it can be linear non-linear.",High"morning linear , afternoon non linear",No sir it can be any linear non-linear because the K should be like occupying all that surrounding part.,HighSo what is K's relationship that is the value of K and its relationship to being linear non-linear?,"Like if red and blue balls are there and if we want to target this in median we want to predict the balls of blue and green.
If it is linear then the surrounding where we have to predict come as green equal to 2 and red equal to 2.

At the first case only if we are getting equal equal equal 1 we can't go into get the predicting when the  advantage.
If all the points are near by that we can do if nothing is there we can't predict that KNN.
That's one disadvantage of KNM.",MediumWhat is one advantage of KNN?,"We can by using distance formula we can find that the KNN easily, like Euclidean and so on.",HighHow is KNN affected by dimensionality of data?,If p equal to 2 that distance it comes in Euclidian's and like the proof is not there and if P equal to 1 then it is a city block.,High,,But what is data dimensionality?,"Like 1 or 2-dimension dimensionality

( some explanation ),NAany feed back for me ,You teach very well.,MediumThank you very much.,thank you sir,NAwhat have you prepared well,sir classification ,NAwhich classification algorithm have you prepared well,K-NN sir ,NAK-NN ?,yes sir !,NAwhat have you studied about K-NN," sir it is like a ..ah K can be anything and it classifies the  all the given inputs and 
then it uses distance and odd based on it and it groups based on K values ,
the majority of the thing taken neareast to the test  value will be taken has class lable",Mediumso groups who take k value equal to maximum k value what happens ?,"sir its like we cannot get an accurate value for , since it’s a random we are grouping , we are gonna group k values, k groups we going to make , 
like in each group k value is gonna be there , so if you are taking more based on that predition …. 
Ah what to say.. hmm , like the majority in that cannot be the correct value of the test case ",Medium"Are you getting confused between the k means algorithm and K-NN?
ok , so what happens when K takes the highest possible value 
why","….(cough)
accuracy reduces
…hm.. Not sure ",Lowso what will you do to improve K accuracy ?,"this , the  K , K accuracy sir ? It can be like the minimal k value so that like ..",Lowwhat is the minimum k value presumed ,"two , three",NAwhy not one ?,"one can be there sir , but it cannot be the exact thing",Mediumwhat is accuracy ?,"accuracy is the test ratio , like we can ah …..( embarassed giggles)
accuracy is a measure we can tell whether the training and tesing is like accurate based on it ",Mediumhow do you tell its accurate or not ,"so we will predict something ,the actual output will be something we can compare these two and give it",Highand from there how will you calculate the accuracy ,"like the diffrence between them , the time calcuator , something like that ",Medium"what is problem with accuracy as a measure 
is accuracy the most perfect measure or does it have drawbacks
what are the drawbacks ?","….
it have some
……",Low"so now can you tell me is high dimensional vectors good or back
when your dataset has high dimensional lot features are there
 is it good for building dataset or not good","high dimensional …
it depends on the problem sir ",Low"take any problem , example that comes to your mind 
now  suppose you have very high dimensional vectors , will it help you or will it create problem for you
it will helpful , so you should  on increasing dimensionality  as much as possible ?
ok , then why do we do reduce the dimentionality 
dimentionality reduction technics and other thing why do we employ them ?","ok 
it will helpful , sir
preferably we can do that",Mediumhow do you handle missing values ,"sir based on the data set if there are more missing values or data imputation we can , we are  doing this 
sir we can use global technique and then central dimencies like mean , median ,mode  we can use
mean is used for dataset where out layers are more .. Ah out layers are less 
median we will use it when the outlayers are more 
mode we use it for categorial conversion ",Mediumwhat is diffrence between mean and median ,"mean is like the total sum divided by the no of entitties 
median is the  after the sorted list ah in the sorted list he middle element",High"ok, I mean that is how you calculate mean and median ",yes sir ,NAwhat is the difference between them,diferrence .. .. Ah,Low"are you understanding stand point is there any diffrence 
or just two different way of calculating ",two diffrence way,NAwhat is the diffrence ?,diffrence is there sir ,Mediumso why would that lead to having different value,"like here it is the average , where it is like ah we are taking the exact middle element ",Highcan the average of the value be ourside the range of data,like here it is the average of the entries ,Medium"ok, I mean that is how you calculate mean and median ",not sure,NAhow did the course go for you ,good sir ,NAany feedback for me ,(mumbling something ),NAthank you very much,no sir ,NAna," In LAS translation with three different models LSTM, biodex and LSTM and seek to seek BAN and DO attention.
In that we are taking the English inputs and we are trying to translate to Hindi text which on minimum 25,000 dataset will actually sir we are getting the accuracy is some like 56% with LSTM and Biola estimate but seek to seek we are getting some 42% accuracy.
So we are trying to change the drive with some another dataset also so that we can get the more accuracy and after that we will find the blue score and rocks score based on the and ground B ground and take it on.",MediumOkay so now this translation so what kind of learning it is.,So like in India our culture many people are not comfortable with English language so for make everyone comfortable and they are able to say their things because in South of the region people don't know Hindi much but in northern part like people know about Hindi so basically they will talk to Hindi everywhere and in South so the coming out from the language barrier we are focusing to take in English translation so it will help for the people who don't know proper like who are not able to afford more learning in English fields.,Low"So yeah you give a motivation behind why you should do it.
But my question is whether it is a supervised learning algorithm or it is unsupervised learning.",So in our case it is we can say supervised learning because it will be we are taking as a labeled forms sir.,Medium"You are taking it as a labeled form.
How ","sir text.
Whatever inputs sir will give based on that we are getting the output and unsupervised like in unsupervised sermons it will take some complex data sir.
So based on our data it will work sir.",Low"
So what do you mean by complex data?",Like sir complex text complex on English words.,Low"Okay.
So in the English words are complex it becomes unsupervised learning.
If the English words used are simple then it becomes supervised learning.","So I have not done it.
Yes sir it may be a perform like that.
I am not going through like old some input we gave but we are not getting the proper service we have thought like that.",MediumYeah but this is not about your project this is about supervised and unsupervised.,"Yes sir.
So in supervised thing sir we are taking text as a in label form.",Highwhat do you mean by  label form can you give an example and explain?,"So like in label form means sir in label form speech recognition that is like sir spam detecting the message spam in email.
This we are checking using supervised learning.",MediumOkay that is correct but yours is a translation problem.,"
Yes sir.",NA"So my question is is translation supervised or unsupervised?
Your explanation I did not understand because you said that English words complexing this words unsupervised simple English words supervised cyber context can you explain?","Sir in supervised and supervised.
Sir in supervised like we will able to find the if messages are some email are some spam email or not it will detect the true false in proof false way and in unsupervised it will just work like a speech recognition form.",Low"Unsupervised speech recognition.
So you are saying speech recognition is not a supervised learning.",No sir.,NA"Okay.
All right.
So can you tell me what is the difference between a classification and regression problem?","Sir classification we basically we can predict like if it is an animal dog or binary like zero one things and in regression form we we cannot say like that regression form like basically we are taking the numerical values.
Make sure data weather data and points values.",Medium"So what is the principle we had then?
What is the difference?
You give some examples yes.
But what is the underlying difference?","Classification in a classify the text.
So difference I am not sure about that.",Medium"Okay.
So can you tell me if it is a classification problem?
What are the different performance metric we can use to measure the model?","So in classification we can use accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores.
These are the matrices to measure the precision, accuracy, recall and F1 scores.",Medium"
So let us talk about accuracy.
How do you find accuracy?
Or how do you calculate accuracy?","
Say accuracy will calculate using there is a formula true positive plus false positive divided by total.
Like total what we will get from our confusion matrix.",Medium"
Okay.
That is how we will calculate accuracy.","
Yes sir.",NA"Can you tell me what is the problem with accuracy as a measure?
What is the disadvantages of using accuracy as a measure?","So this is the result of accuracy.
This is the advantage of accuracy.
So u r like why we ar using accuracy  ",Medium"No, I am asking.
If we use accuracy what problems we may encounter","
So like in data set if we are using the accuracy we can predict like how data how our model is performing.",High"So there is what accuracy does.
But what is the problem with that?",Sir.problem with that,HighIs there no problem with accuracy?,"
No sir.
In our project like we are finding accuracy for matching the prediction and what we are getting as output.",High"Okay.
How did the course go for you?","
Sir, well.",NAit went well?,yes,NAOkay .Any feedback for me?,"No sir.
Everything is fine.",High"
Thank you very much.Your number is 106",yes sir,NA What have your prepared for the Viva?,Sir decision tree,HighWhat is your overfitting?,"In decision tree, overfitting is when the Decision tree is almost equal to the number of features.
So, and now to prevent overfitting, there are two techniques.
We can use a pre-pulling or a pro-pulling.
Pre-pulling involves setting the Decision trre before hand.
And post-pulling involves cutting when the tree is fully formed.
You cut off some of the branches to make sure it's not overfitting.",HighHow do you know whether there is overfitting or not?,"
Well first, we can use some metrics.
First one is our information gain or gene index.
We can use those metrics to find out if it's overfitting.
And also based on the performance and the model, if it's having too much relationship with the training data but not the test data, then we know that the model is overfitting and then we know that there's overfitting in the decision tree.",HighYou said gene index can help you understand overfitting.,"Well, gene index can, it's a metric used to select and order to not select and order.
So, find a branch and not select a branch.
The lower the gene index, the better the branches.
So, let's say in overfitting, we want to remove some branches.
So, if it has high gene index, then we should not remove it.
It has low gene index in it should have it.",High"Yeah, that is for branch constructions or tree constructions.
But how does it tell you whether there is overfitting on that?
Okay, let's understand.
What is overfitting?","Overfitting is when the model gets has a too many unwanted, has no, there's no noise in the model because it has too many unwanted relationships in the training data.
And those, and that correspondingly does not help it in the test data.
It got too many features like patterns, basically patterns.
So, this, it learned too many unwanted patterns in the training data, which are not unwanted and which is basically noise in the model.
And it does not help when it's being tested in the test data.",HighAnd is gene index calculated on training data or tested?,On training data.,NA"So, then how do you know how will this calculation holds for tested?","Oh, no sir.",NA"So, then how do you use it to find out whether it is overfitting or not?",I can't use it.,NASure.,Yes sir.,NA"
Okay.
Well, you use Decision tree or equivalent of a decision tree for adding the regression problem.",Yes sir.,NAHow?,"So, decision tree basically is written in class.
Let's say yes, no.
But then in the regrsssion tree, you can do based on that say H altitude less than some H or greater than some H. And this is called a regression tree.
So, when a decision tree, basically to use a decision tree in the regression tree, you can use a regression tree.",Medium"Okay.
But in at a leaf node in a Decision tree, you give a class level.","
Maybe like less than 10, like in numerical value instead of a class table, we can use regression problem.",High"
But in a regression, the outcome is a continuous value.
So, how will you construct a leaf node with continuous values?","
Let's say that we are speaking based on some H-Apti-Vit.
And we can split it based on less than 10 or more than 10.",High"But like that is in the attribute.
So, but I am talking about outcome.
You don't predict an attribute, right?
You use an attribute to predict an outcome.",To split the tree basically.,High"
Yes.","And is it a split?
You can use it to split based on that say age is less than some 50 years or age is greater than 50 years.
You can use it to split.",MediumBut your explanation is about continuous attributes.,Or how can we use it for this?,High"A regression can be done with continuous attributes or with discrete attributes.
Right.
But the question here is about the outcome prediction.","So, in that case, we can use some unsampled learning such as bagging a boosting.",HighWhat is the difference between bagging and boosting?,"First difference is that bagging runs in parallel.
And the boosting runs sequentially.
Bagging stands for bootstrap aggregating.
Basically, it builds multiple weak models in parallel.
Whereas in bagging and boosting, it um, let's say it builds in its models and sequins.
And maybe the second model of try to correct the errors made in the fresh model.",HighYou said boosting run sequentially.,"It runs parallel to you sir.
Like boosting runs sequentially.
Bagging runs parallel.",HighWhat does it mean?,Boasting runs sequentially.,NAYes.,"
So, um, it builds multiple models but they run in sequentially.
Let's say you run a first model.
Then the second model tries to fix errors or tries to correct errors made in the first model.
And there you have the model such improving.",HighIs this during training time or test time?,"
During training time.",NA"Then why would you say it runs sequentially?
During testing time, do they run sequentially or parallel?","Ten sequentially sir.
Like, when you trusting the model, then runs sequentially or?",HighWhy should you run sequentially during testing time?,"It's only running.
Training time.",Medium"
So during testing time what happens?",It predicts the outcome based on the model.,High"
On sequentially or parallel?",In sequentially.,NA"
Okay.
So how do you evaluate the performance of a regression?","Using information gain or gene index?
Gene index?",High"
Performance measure?","
Well, first we can use any insert matrix like let's say, um, F1 score or recall position accuracy, mean absolute error or um, which armacy?",MediumYou are naming everything.,"Well, let's say loss function is some RMSC, then um, based on accuracy.",High"Based on accuracy.
So you will measure the performance of a regression tree using accuracy","Can you use it, can you use it, accuracy?",Medium"Can you give an example scenario, example use guess where regression tree can be used?
A problem scenario.
But this kind of problem I can use regression tree.
Can you give an example?","When you have like a large numerical dataset?
Let's say you have, um, let's say height and weight.
And you have age.",High"So you are predicting age from height and weight.
Very good.
So let's take that example.
Let's say you have 10 people and their actual age is given to you and you build a regression tree and using that regression tree, using height and weight for the 10 people you predict their age.
How will you calculate accuracy from here?
Now for 10 people you have actual age and for 10 people you have predicted age.
How do you calculate accuracy?
Did you understand my question?","Yes sir.
I have actually predicted age.
How do you calculate the accuracy?",MediumCorrect.,Can you solve something like mean absolute error here?,High"So that is a different method.
You may, you basically said, did you say you can use accuracy for regression tree?",Yes sir.,NA"
I am asking, how do you calculate accuracy in this scenario?","Sir.
You can't.",NA"
So can you use your regression tree?",No sir.,NA"Okay?
Then what can you use?","
To build a tree, you have some information given that I am probably.",Medium"
Okay?","
You said sir, how to measure the how well your model is doing?",High"
Yes.
That is what is my question.","
I think you can use information given also.",High"
Information given.
Okay.
Is there regression tree sensitive to data normalization?","
Yes sir.
Like sensitive to outliers.",High"
They sensitive to outliers.
How?","Because of the way we calculate entropy.
Information given is how we calculate entropy.
entropy is probability in laptop probability.
So let's say there is some, let's say the age example.
If my age is, let's say there is a missed value, let's say it is 6000.
And then the other ages are like 10, 15, 20.
Then the regression tree might take that 6000.
So that's where sensitive to outliers.",High"I still did not understand.
Can you explain?","Yes sir.
So basically let's say there are some values.
Let's say between 10 and 15 years, we have some 10 and 15 values.
And let's say one of the values is accidentally for a 6000 or something.
Then, while calculating of the information gain,",High"
 do you calculate information gain based on the actual value or the probability of the value?",Probability of the value.,NA"
So how would the outlier affect your probability?","
It won't sir",NAThen how would it affect information gain?,"It won't be affected by outliers.
Because the probability of the 6000 age would be that it does.
So information gain would be very less.
So we won't consider it.",MediumSo is normalization required?,"No, no sir.",NA"
How did the course go for you?",it went well,High"It went well.
What part of the teaching or the course did you like?",I liked that before mid sem portion,High"
And if any feedback for me, for my improvement?
Don't hesitate.","After midsem, I think it was a bit rushed.
I understood well before midsem, after midsem, it was a bit more rushed.",High"So it became little fast?As people met, it was going at a regular pace and after midsum, it became fast.",yes sir,NA"
And that basically led to some missing capturing the content.
",yes sir,NAThank you.,,NASo tell me what have you prepared for Viva?,"Sir, what have i prepared?
Sir like SVMs, PCA kind of.
So like I didn't prepare as such, I like I can't understand.",Medium"Okay, how do you want me to ask you a question from?","Like sir, we have any everything other than harmonic marcomodels.",HighHarmonic marcomodels.,That one I didn’t study peoperly.,High"Okay, what are support vectors?","Support vectors are basically the points.
I mean observations against which the margins lie like for example, I was drawing for you.
So like suppose these are like we have some observations and then no first I will do this.
So you have the hyperplane here and you have these two margin hitter equally spaced right.
So hyperparameter are the points where on which the margins are the support vector lines.
The support vector lies",Medium"Okay, what are support vectors?","Sorry, not support vector though.
I'm just saying hyperplane lines.",Medium"Okay, so support vectors are the observations which lie on hyperplane.","No sir, they lie on the margins.",High"Lie on the margins.
But margin is the gap between the two hyperplanes which are touching the boundary of the class.","Sir, no sir, like the thing is like so these things are not like hard margins or direct soft margins.
So it's like some points might be allowed to lie within the margins.
But that will result in misclassification rate.
So by doing cross validation and stuff, you should find out that which set of support vectors gives us the best of this one results.",HighWhat is the kernel function?,"Yes, so kernel function is basically here function which maps the existing data points right.
Do some other dimension like between so that they can be separated.
So I'll give an example here also.
Suppose you have like data like this, so like this and then cross and again dots.
Like in this x axis, they are not, I mean in one dimension, they are not separable at all.
Because as you can see the dots are on either side of the crosses.
And so you cannot, you cannot make a plane which, plane, no, you cannot make a point which separates both of them.
Because this is one dimension.
But then if you map, if you use this one, kernel function then it will map it.
For example, the polynomial function, then from one dimensional space, you are going to two dimensional space because you are having the points right now.
So you will know, you will apply the kernel function.
So we will get a set of new points lying in the x, y, plane.
So like like this.
And now we can draw, we can draw, we can draw separating hyper plane like this.
So it's like you, you know, you cannot able to be separated in this x axis.
After applying the kernel function, you can separate them.",Low"So during testing time, the support vector machine, operate on the principle of distance or on the principle of similarity.","So similarity, what is it?",HighI can add the front of the same distance as you.,"Sir, so like.",Medium"What is similarity?
How many similarity matrix you know?","Sir, right.
Jackard and simple matching and cosine.",HighSo any one of them could be getting used or... ,"No, sorry, the operation distance.",High"Distance.
Okay.
How do you construct a decision tree?","So... Yeah.
So you have the initial set of observations.
Then for each of them, you calculate either the entropy or the gene index.
Then... Yeah.
You calculate the gene index or the entropy, right?
Sir, I forgot.",Medium"Okay, fine.
What is normalization of data?","So normalization of data is like, you have the initial data.
And then you are converting it to some other range.
So to minimize the effect some features might have.
Because like, out of some like a feature, there might be some which are extremely high in magnitude, right?
So in cases like k-means clustering or even support vector machine, it might be that those features might dominate because of the magnitude.
Which you do not want, because we don't know.
So we reduce the data set in such a way that everything is close and magnitude.",High"So you said for k and m k-means and support vector machines, the range variation can create an effect.
What about decision tree?
Does normalization affect decision trees?",No.,NAWhy not?,"Sir, because the entropy or calculation is basically depending on the probability, right?
And sir, even if you reduce the thing, the probabilities of the features, they will not change because suppose you have got... Like suppose you have got one features vector repeated like maybe two or three times, right?
And you are calculating the probabilities.
So even if you reduce the range, your all of them will be identical because they are the same magnitude.
So after normalization, there will be in the same range.",Medium"Very good.
How did you find the course?","Sir, I found it pretty interesting.
But like some cases you went little slowly in my opinion.",High"You are a smart guy, so it takes you a short time.","Sir, I did not answer.",High"No, because there are people who say that I am going fast.
You are saying I am going slow.
Some situations.
Okay.
So I have to balance between both kinds of students.
Yeah, I went slowly at the beginning so that even the people who are little weak and catch up.
And then I went fast towards that because I thought that you have already kind of gathered in the back.
Anyway, any feedback for me?",Feedback.,NAHow can I improve?,"Sir, like lab assignments are good, right?
But sir, in my opinion there should be more theory assignments also.
Like because I don't know, I feel like theory should be there in that aspect of assignment.",HighHow do you propose to do that?,"Sir, it is like in classes you sometimes give homework assignments, right?
So instead of that was little irregular.
Sir, so in my opinion it should be like lab assignments only but like so every week you should get like a big set of questions which we give to you over and over the next week.
Like that",High"Sure.
And that's something which I am doing earlier.
But then yeah, I can bring it back.",Thank you very much.,NAAnything else?,I don't know.,NAThank you.,Thank you.,NA" Okay, what have you prepared?","Sir,i prepared before mid and after mid have prepared classification , clustering and some what neural networks?",Low"You have prepared clustering and neural networks.
Very good.
Tell me what does a neural network on system?","Sir, a neural network consist of input and it takes input and weighted weights and after that it, after the bias and activation functions.",Medium"The neural network takes inputs and weights by bias and activation function.
How do you know what weights you have to give?","Sir, by checking and analyzing with data,",High"
how? how do you do that?",i dont know.,High"
you dont know.
What is activation function?","Sir, activation function is summation of predicted values log of ah.. log of.",MediumCan you name one activation function?,No sir.,NA" you cannot name a activation function
And what does the activation function do?","So, it will analyze it first like first data, inputs added with weights and then it is process.
Processed with..",Low"
Sorry.","
sir,i forgot.",High"okay
So, let us say you have built a neural network.
But you have some data, input data which is categorical in nature.
Like whether you are a boy or a girl.
How will you use this data for training or testing?
How will you use this data on your model?","So, I will divide into state data for training and testing and I will analyze only boys and girls.",High"Yes. No idea , Okay
Do you know what is normalized?","
Yes.",NAWhat is normalized?,"with normalization, if a data set, we can arrange the data even better.
By removing outliners.",High"Can you explain this?
How you will remove outliers?","
So, with normalization, I do not exactly want to do it by min-max normalization.",Medium"Can you write the formula for min-max normalization?
Yes.
What does this formula do?","Sir, we are going to get a data as a first data and then it was reduced to another data.
Means it was reduced and  normalization.
That is, after normalization, new max and new min-max, we are going to find certain element in older data how it is in new data.",Medium"
Yes, but what does the formula do?
There are different parts of the formula, right?
What do they do?
Why are they there?
What function do they accomplish?","
No, exactly dont know.",Medium"You do not know.
Do you know what is the difference between mean and medium?","
yes sir",NAWhat is it?,"
Sir, mean is like summing all the elements dividing by total elements.
And median is like, middle elements.",High"
How is the middle elements?
Can you ask, talk a little more?","I.. total elements by 2.
Total elements by 2.",Low"Total elements by 2.
Then, it becomes the middle number.
So, if you have 100 numbers, then median is 100 by 2, 50.","
50 plus 50 adding the both elements by 2, then we can take it as a median.
If it is even, even a distributed means, ",High"
what is mode?","Sir, I have little consciousness with median, some mode, I think, Most number of, number of high frequencies.
Number of high frequencies, which number appeared more in the data?",Low"Okay.
All right.
How do you reduce dimensionality of data?","
By feature extraction.
By feature extraction and outliers.",High"Okay.
And by future extraction, you can reduce dimensionality.
Okay.
Can you explain how?",exactly don't know.,High"You don't know.
How did that course go for you?","
good sir.",NA"
How was it good?","Like I am getting basic ideas, before I don't know much about this, I am getting ideas, learning step by step.",HighAny feedback for me?,"
Everything is good.",High"
Thank you very much.",,NA" So, what have you prepared well for viva?","Sir, I study down, study down my project and..,",Medium"
 in case study done your project and", means whatever we are using on project.,MediumWhatever you are using on your project that is what you have studied.,"In classification, classification.",High"Classification.
What is your project about?","So, vector interpretation of multiple solutions to same questions.",High"All right.
So, tell me what is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?","
So, in supervised learning you will have a target attribute.
In unsupervised learning you will have a target attribute.
You will group the, you will make it into groups.
Like how we did in our project, we grouped multiple solutions of same question to one cluster.
So, clustering comes under unsupervised.
Supervised we have a very regression classification.
Where we have a target attribute",Medium"Okay.
Right.
So, tell me what do you mean by that data interpretation?","The data interpretation is for filling up the missing values.
You have two different types in that where we can, impute with a global value or a statistical value like main, where in the main, median, like the mode.",High"
Right.
So, where do we use which one?
You gave all the measures.
Now, tell me where which one is used?","So, maybe based on the data it will be, like it is repeating data, we will take the mode.
And if the data is from a range to range, we will take a median part.
Or a data is to some uncertain, some like temperature data, if you take, means you can take a global variable of 98.6 degrees celcius.
Just like that.",High"
Right.
Yes.
So, that brings to a very important question.
Suppose the range of the data is changing. Okay","Yes, sir.",NA"Okay.
 will the standard deviation for the data change.","
It…",Low"
Do you know what is the formula for standard deviation?","Yes, sir.",NACan you write it down?, sir..,Low"Okay.
That is the formula for standard deviation.","
Sir, summation.
Summation.
Yes, okay.
In square root of variance.",Medium"
In square root of variance.","
Yes, sir.",NA"Very good.
Now, suppose you are using a normalization technique to normalize that data.
And put it into a different scale.","
Ok,sir.",NA"
Will the standard deviation change?","So, we are changing the data points of everything.",High"
You are changing in the sense that you are scaling it.
You know what is normalization.","
So, what i meant is that?
If X is some 90 or something, we will scale it between 0 to 1 if we suppose.
So, we take these points for taking standard deviation.",MediumCorrect.,"So, it will change definitely.",HighWhy it will change?,"So, because this var.., this various, so much difference.
Because for this, again some different mean or some other mean will come.
So, this value is certainly normalization",Medium"Okay.
Very good.
Will it affect the models performance?","If we take for our understanding perspective, it is better to normalize for ahh.. what did i say.",High"You are doing clustering in your project, right?",yes sir.,NA"
Suppose I normalize that data.
Will it lead to generation of a different outcome in clustering?","If you know normalize that data, different outcome.
I think no sir.
Because it may be dependent on the data sets, but for our data set it is, I think no sir.
Because they are grouped into clusters based on similar, similarity.
T hen we take some similarity like how we do with db scan by density based clustering, we check this similarity between two vector numberings and then group them like that we do.",MediumWhat are the hyperparameters for db scan?,"hyperparameters for db scan.
I think there are no three different parameters.",Low"
Can you explain the db scan algorithm
?","Sir, when there are two, I mean sir, I don't know what, how it is a euclinar project.
When there are two vector numberings, we will check this.
The viscane is density based clustering.
So, we take the density parameter into consideration and check both the vector numberings.
If the measure density parameter comes in the range, we cluster them into the group.",MediumHow is it different from k-means clustering?,"
k-means is a hyperparameter clustering.
We define k before doing this clustering.",High"So, what is wrong with it?
Means we… Is there the only difference or there is some other difference?","
So, k is predefined.
So, we can obtain those many clusters only at that time.
Like how we didn't have a project is, we applied only db scan and this can we did'nt apply kmeans because we need to use a hyperparameter k value, which we should define before doing the clustering.
So, we didn't use K-means clustering.",Medium"
How did the course go for you?","
It was a good understanding.
New knowledge I didn't… Because before they started this course, I didn't have any knowledge in the machine learning.
After this, I had decent enough knowledge.",MediumAny feedback for my improvement?,No sir.,NA"
Thank you.Thank you.
your roll number is 114.",Yes sir 114.,NAis your project  classification or refression ,"It is a classification, clustering and the sum part of the project in the regression part.",HighWhat is your project?,"Our project is based on the regression analysis of the mathematical expressions, algebraic expressions using the regression models.",HighWhy are you using the regression there?,"
Since in the answering part we have the continuous first thing.
We have the marks, it is like 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,  and all these continuous parts.
So to calculate that we are using the regression, because that may or may not be the correct one, it is like labels.
They are not predefined.
That's why we are using the regression.
Predefined we will be using classification.
So it is not predefined and it is continuous, not discrete.
So that's why there is.",High"
So you have mathematical expressions, ","
algebraic expressions.",High"
They are available to you as vector or as text.","They are available as a text, we have converted into vectors.
",HighHow?,"It is using the embedding's math, code, but another thing.",HighWhy did you do embedding?,"It's like when they are in text form, they will be can't, for the features form, we can't directly convert to the text, we can't analyze the text directly since we are mean, when we convert into vectors, there will be these many dimensions which resembles the same text.
So means like it is somewhat positive, somewhat negative, 0.01 or 0.0 to 1 something, till there are 7 decimals like that, where I have answer.
Each embedding represents the each text like that.
Means like for the point, one text, for the verb like x or variables, numbers, for everything there are separate embeddings, vector.
Means that's why we are using that.
So to analyze, it will be easy when you calculate the performance for regression.
","So, what are the different performance metrics used for regression?","MSC, RMSC, MAPE and R2 scores.",High"
Can you write the formula for RMSC?
",Yes ,NA"
What have you written here?
What is this?
X, X, what is this?",mean ,NA"X, what mean?",Mean and the individual observation.,High"Okay.
So, you are subtracting the mean from the original observation.
From the original observation.","
Yes, means it.",NA"Okay.
And then what is this one?","X, the observation and.",NA"So, where is your prediction?","
Sir,
you don't need the predictions to calculate.
RMSC, ",High"So, where is it?
It is not there in the formula.
What is the output of this?","Output of the system prediction.
No, no.
No idea.",Medium"No idea.
Okay.
So, what is the data normalization?","
Yes,",NA what is it?,"It means that if there are any external means like 1 to 5 we are having the data continuously.
But there is another number that is coming from the means like with the used variations deviation like 20 or 13 like that.
Then we use the data normalization to remove these out layers, 20 and 30.
And we set that to the 1 to 5 like that.",High"Okay.
We take the 1 to 5 like this and all this.
Okay.
So, you are saying you will be able to remove from data some out layers using normalization.",Yes sir.,NA"
Okay.
What are the different normalization techniques you know?","Zscore normalization.
And like that sir.",Medium"Okay.
So, how do you do Zscore normalization?","
Zscore is using the mean and the standard deviation.
So, means it will be like z equal to kind of a to 4.",MediumYes.,"The Z value is equal to x minus mu by sigma sub 2.
The mean and the variance means standard deviation are used to calculate the Z value.
And again from the Z table, means we will be having the Z table, Zscore table.
And then we will be assigning the number to that.
",MediumSorry.,"After getting the Z values, there is a Zscore table P of z will be calculating.",MediumHow do you calculate P of z?,"
It is from the Zscore table.
It means P of z less than or equal to x something x from x.
",MediumWhat is x?,"It is like the, these x are the observations.
For all these, the x is a label.
If this z value is less than or equal to the x1 observations, in the total observations of x, we are checking whether the z is present or not from the Zscore table and we are giving a value for that.",Medium"Okay.
Right.
And how what will you do if the data is available in categorical values?","Categorical values.
First we will be using encoding.
We can use it sir.",Medium"
What kind of encoding will you use?
","There are two label and one words sir.
For the label encoding, if you use that, it will be intact sir.
The data storage will be saved.
Means like Monday to Saturday, we can give 1 to 7.
But when we use the 1 hot encoding sir, for the Monday to Saturday, it requires 7 bits, 0 for first question.
Means for Sunday, all 0s and last bit has 1 for Monday, 5 0s, 1 and 10 0.
So for this one, the data will be, means like the storage takes a little more.
Because it is converting to vector form.",LowWhat is converting to vector form?,These 0s and 1s.,NAOkay.,"
7 bit 1.",Low"
Okay.
Right.
So now, if you do Z-score normalization, sorry, you are doing 1 hot encoding.
Does the data dimensionality increase or does it decrease?
","Increases sir.
Because from the vectors, when it is from 1, we are changing that to Monday, means like 1 dimension sir, Monday is an M. And we are converting that to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 1, 0.
We are increasing the dimension sir.
Now it becomes 7 vectors.
So the dimensionality increases.",MediumSo does it have any disadvantage by increasing dimensionality?,"Sir, when we increase dimensionality, the processing will be a little complex than the single time when we do 1-div dimensionality.
When the dimensional increases, the complexity of the processing also increases.
",High"Right.
So you have disadvantage.","
Yes sir.",NA"
Is there any advantage?","
I have no idea.",NA"
Okay.
How did the course go for you?","Well sir.
Along with that, we got even from the, even we have performed the small pattern of FDS.
And that also we have results sir.
These are glomatic, clustering and all this in the data sense.
But, okay.",MediumAny any feedback for me?,All good sir.,NA"
Thank you very much.",Thank you.,NA117,"
Yes.",NA" Please close the door.
What did you study for viva?","Sir basics i studied Basic like more classification.
More classification.",Medium"Okay.
What is the difference between naive based classifier and hmm?","Sir, naive  based classifier is first we will assume that all the features are independent.
And then through Bayer's theorem we will do the classifier.
Hmm i don't know sir.",Medium"
What is Bayer's theorem?","Bayer's theorem is like a finding probability of one with respect to other and if we need to find the probability of a by b.
Also p of b by a, n, p of a by all of.",High"What is a, what is b?
In your classifier scenario.","If we want to find a, early.
Prob, as for suppose if probability of dog such that cat with respect to cat.
Given that it is cat.",Medium"Complete.
I thought you are still telling something.
Okay.
Fine.
So this is naive based algorithm.",First we will assume that features are independent.,HighHow do you find if the features are independent?,"
Now we find using cosine similarity.
If the values between 0 and 1 then the features are independent.",High"Features are independent.
Suppose they are not independent.
Okay.
What will you do?",I don't know sir.,High"
Okay.
Suppose you normalize the data.
Does it affect independent.","If you can normalize the data, does it affect independent?
",HighYes.,"
No sir.
No sir.",NAIt does not.,"Normalization is converting the vector into one form.
Like main max scaling.",HighRight.,"So.
I think it does not affect independent.",Medium"It does not affect independent.
Okay.
Good.
Suppose you have categorical data.
How do you find out if the features are independent of?","
We will first do encoding.
Like label encoding or one coding?",High"
What is the difference between label encoding and one hot coding?","A label encoding is will assign the labels.
Like for a red, let's say, not for a, suppose, poor.
Let's say it is zero and very poor.
It's one satisfied.
It's two.
But in one hot encoding, if that, the data is present in that data set, then it will put it as one.
Remaining every label will become zero.",Medium"So, when you do one hot encoding, does the dimensionality of the vector increase or does it?",Increases.,NA"What is the effect of increasing dimensionality on the performance of a classifier?
","
Sir, it may become overfitting.
Noisy.",Medium"It may become overfitting.
Okay.
So, what would you do then?","Sir, again, I will reduce the dimensionality of that.",HighHow?,"Like there are some techniques, PCA or LDA.",High"
How does PCA help reduce dimensionality?","
PCA, it converts the vector into lesser dimension.
It mainly focuses on variance.",HighHow does PCA convert it into lesser dimension?,"The vector of one dimension, it converts into lesser dimension.",Medium"
How?","How, I don't know.
But it maintains the variance.
Same variance.
That is the…",Low"But it will reduce such dimensionality.
And if it reduces dimensionality, variance is a return.","
Maximum variance will do it.",High"
Maximum variance will be return.
Can you tell me one situation where PCA will not work?
It will fail.","
It will fail.
Now, PCA is used for unsupervised.",HighPCA is used for unsupervised,"
PCA is used for unsupervised.
Without putting any labels, but LDA we will put labels.",Medium"Can you give one example problems scenario where unsupervised learning will be used?
",Supervised.,NAUnsupervised.,Clustering.,NA"Clustering.
Where?
Tell me where clustering can be used.","
Clustering can be like for example basket.
Market basket analysis.
In that, we find the pattern in the market.
First of all, a person by bread.
If a person by bread, he will buy jam and butter along with that.
So, we will find a pattern like that and we will put it together.",MediumWhat algorithm do you use for market basket analysis?,"
I don't know sir.",HighThen how can you say it is unsupervised learning?,"So, we are finding the patterns in that.
There are no labels.
Predefined labels.",HighBut what is learning there?,"Another example is market.
Finding the similarities of the market.",MediumWhat do you mean by similarity of the market?,"Not Similarities of market.
Finding the patterns in the customer.
Buying some goods.
Example.",High"
Okay.
How did the course go for you?","
Good.
",NAWhat was good about the course?,"Sir, I learned this course that is a little bit.
I don't know what is ML before also.
Okay.",LowWhat is your feedback for me?,It's good.,NAThank you very much.,"Thanks.
Sir, I was not good.",HighYou tell me.,I think it's not good.,High"
You think it's not good?",Yes sir.,NA"Okay.
You can improve next time.",,NA" So what have you prepared for viva?
Where should I ask you questions from?",That classification sir.,Medium"Classification.
Any specific model?","These and all i prepared ,formulas sir.",Medium"Formulas you prepared
How will you use a support vector machine for multi-class scenario?",,NA"No idea.
Okay.
So for classification, what are the performance metrics which are used?","For clustering.
For clustering.",NA"For clustering.
Classification.
No idea. Okay
What is normalization of Data",Normalization i know sir.,NA"You know. Okay tell me what is it.
Do you know names of some normalised algorithms?",,NA"No
Okay.
What do you understand by vector independence?","The Vector independence.
Telling the independent or dependent?
",MediumYes.,"By taking some examples.
Let's take an example of this.
Independent or independent like that?
If these two vectors are the normalised, if this vector is multiple with two means, it will be get this vector.
We can tell that it is dependent or else.",LowHow do you present that mathematically?,"Mathematically.
One by x plus.
Like this, two x plus two.
Two x plus two y.
This vector.",High"Okay.
What are the problems of using high dimensional vectors?",High dimensional vectors means we can't tell like this.,Medium"Then how do you tell?
Okay.
Do you know what is encoding?","In encoding.
In  encoding two types are there.
In encoding two types means one will be in range sir.
Zero to.
If we, if we, at days are there.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, like that.
Monday we will get one like that.
Zero to seven sir.
In encoding, that is one type.
That is one type.
One type.
Female and male.
For female, zero or male, one.
Where is that, that, that names, that's two types are there",Low"
Why do we need encoding?","
To represent.",NA"What do you mean by that?
Can you explain?","In math, it goes over more.
If we, if we take zero to sound mean Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Wednesday.
Like that up to Sunday, Monday, Monday we will get zero.
Monday, one, Tuesday, two like that.
In female and male, there only two is there no sir.
Or three male or male.
Zero, one.
Only zeros and one star.",Low"
Correct.
That is correct.
That is not my question.
My question is why do we do encoding?
Not how.
You are saying Sunday will become zero, Monday will become one.
Tuesday will become one.","
Like that examples will come.
",Medium"But why do we have to make Sunday equal to zero Monday equal to one?
Let Sunday be Sunday, Monday be Monday, no?
What is the problem?","
This is a mathematical problem",High"Okay.
How did you find the course?
How did you find the course?
How did the course go for you?
Any feedback for me?",No sir,NA"
Thank you very much.",,NA Good morning.,sir,NA"Ram Charan, good morning.","
Good morning, sir.",NADid you have breakfast?,Yes.,NAHave you prepared well?,Prepared.,NAWhich module have you prepared well?,"
Supervisor learning and unsupervised.",High"Supervisor.
Okay.
What is your roll number?","
123, sir.",NA"123.
Alright.
What is supervised learning?","In supervised learning, we have classification and regression, sir.",HighYou have classification and regression in supervised learning?,"Yeah.
In classification, decision tree.",HighWhy is it called supervised learning?,"
Predicting the outcomes from the inputs.",High"
Why?","Inputs and outputs are target value and inputs are given.
That is all.",Medium"Okay.
That is why it is called supervised.
But why?","From input values, we will find the predicted values.",High"Okay.
So if the output values are given, how does it help you?","
Output values, we have to predict the output values from input attributes.
Attributes",Medium"Okay.
Okay.
Right.
So that is why it is called supervised learning.",…..,NA"
What is unsupervised learning then?",KNN.,NA"
KNN is unsupervised.
What is K in KNN?","value.
Nearest neighbor value.
K value.",NA"
What value it is?",Based on the question.,High"I didn't understand.
Can you explain?","If...
Number of nearest neighbors.",Medium"Number of nearest neighbors.
That is K. Is K a parameter or hyperparameter?","
Parameter.",NA"
It is a parameter.
So you learn the value of K during training.",The question only is given as K value.,Medium"
Then how does it become a parameter?",Hyperparameter.,NA"Hyperparameter.
okay
Now suppose I have given a problem for KNN classifier.
Other than data set.
What should I give to you?","Some points.
From that we have to calculate the distance and we can find the KNN. ",High"Yes.
The data set is given.
You have the data set that is already there.
What other information you need from me for you to build a KNN classifier?",no sir.,NA"You don't know.
Okay.
So how do you measure whether the KNN classifier which you have built is good or bad?","If K value is 1 or 2 means accurate means we can find.
If it is too low or we can say it is overfitting.",Medium"Overfitting.
You are saying K value too low is overfitting.
Why?
What is overfitting?","
That K value is too low.",High"K value too low is overfitting.
Yeah.
That you have already said.
But my question is what is overfitting?",A low variance,NA"Low variance.
When do we say a situation?
Tell me the situation where we call that it is overfitting.","
After calculating the distance.",High"After calculating the distance.
We will call it as overfitting.", not overfitting.,NA"then.
So what is overfitting?
That is my question.",Definition i don't know,High"
Definition you don't know.
Why?
Suppose we have very high dimensional vectors.
Okay.
Is it good or bad?","
Means in what?",NA"
I have high dimensional vector.
That is now lot of features are there with me.
Okay.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?","
For what?
For predicting the output?",High"
Classification.","
Maybe it is.
We have high attributes.
We can predict the output easily.",High"Okay.
So it is good.
Is it always good?",That one no.,NA"That one you don't know.
Okay.
Can you think of a situation where it is not good?",Means very.,NA"Or suppose we have lot of features.
What kind of problem can it generate?
Or can it create for us?","
Correct output.
From which attribute we have to take the predicted value we can't measure no sir.
If too many different input attributes are there.
Too high at.",Medium"
Okay.
you know what is normalization of data what is it?","
Formula",NA" Formula No, no I'm asking explain what is normalization what do what is normalization why do we do it?","
Distribution of data ",NA"
Distribution of data what do you mean by that?",If the data set is given from that we have to we can normalize it,MediumYeah but what is normalization?,No.,NASuppose I say multiplication what is multiplication?,"
Product of two numbers ",HighProduct of two numbers that is called multiplication similarly what is normalization of data?,"
Taking the average value",HighWhat is average?,Average If 10 attributes is given total addition of 10 by number of by 10 average ,Low"
So what does that number average tell you about the data?",Most repeated value most repeated value I think Not repeated sir middle value ,Low"
Average is the middle value?",Uh huh ,LowOkay no problem How did the course go for you?,Good,NA" Why was it good?
What was good about the course?",Teachings,NAWhich aspect of teaching you found it good?,"
Explaining clearly ",HighExplaining KNN was good,Clearly ,NAExplaining clearly was good Okay Can I do anything to improve?,No You are good sir,NA Good Nothing can be improved Okay Thank you very much, Thank you sir ,NA What have you prepared?,Everything I revised like basic only.,MediumYour project is a classification problem right?,Yes sir.,NAWhat are the different performance metrics used for classification problem?,"
Precision recall accuracy of F1 score.",HighWhat are the difference between precision and accuracy?,"
The accuracy is based on the true-positive-plus-false-positive.
It takes all the actual predicted values by total values.
Precision is based on the true-positive.
Only true-positive by true-positive-plus-false-positive.
It is a ratio of true-positive by all the predicted positive values.",High"Okay
That is the formula you said.",Yes sir,NAWhat does it mean?,"Precision is the measure of the predicted true-positive values.
Precited true-positive values to the ratio of actual predicted values of model.",High"That is again a formula you are talking about ratio.
What does it mean?
When you say ok precision is, suppose I said that precision is 60%.
What does it mean to you?","It means like true-positive are more then...
There are more true-positive values than wrong predicted true values.",Medium"Ok. Right ,What is margin and support vector message class of here?","It is the separation between the two classes, support vectors.
The more the margin, the better the model.
less the margin, the worse the model.
It is basically the distance between two sub-support vectors.
",High"Ok.
Right.
So, more margin is good.","
Because it is more separated no sir.",Medium"So, why is it good?","Like it is not over lap.
It is more separated.
So, the model works good on that.
Even... ",HighYou are telling right?,"
If it is, the margin is too less means.
We cannot classify more easily.
If the margin is more, it is more separated.
So, we can...
The model works so well.",Medium"Ok. Will this large margins, small margin, have any impact on the performance metric?",Yes sir.,NACan you relate?,"
Yes sir.",NA"Tell me.
Suppose margin is large",Yes.,NA"How what will happen to your precision, recall and all that?","
Sir, if margin is large, misclassification and all, I don't know how I know.",Low"You have, you are just getting tense or stressed or scared or whatever.
Ok.
Yes.
Give it a shot.
It may be wrong.
Why are you worried?
You are going in the right direction.","If margin is large, misclassification, things are not going to get into the soft margin.
So that we... ",Medium"
You don't want to even try.
Ok.
So, is SVM a supervised classifier or unsupervised?","
Supervised.",NAWhy?,"Sir, it works on the first labeling of all the representation in graph are done by the supervised.
So that if new unseen data comes based on the supervised, all the like seen data will classify now.
I mean, first we classify them based on the labels.
And for unseen data, we'll take based on the group it belongs to will classify unseen data.",Medium"Ok.
So, that is why it is supervised.","Yes, sir.
Like, it takes the labels for trying.",HighCan you use support vector methods in a multi-class scenario?,"
Yes, sir.",NAHow?,"
In multi-class scenario, you can take one class one side, other remaining classes one side.
In that way, we can try more, more ways and more like we can form a brute force, like one model, one set remaining classes one side, two classes one side remaining classes one side.
In that way, we can form one.",Medium"You can work on it.
That is correct.Okay
So, now, suppose you are using a neb classifier.","
Yes.",NAWhat is the assumption you make before you start?,"
Independent.
Features are independent.",High"Ok.
Independent.
Good.
How do you find if the features are independent or not?
","How do you find, first we make the, we make assumption as the features are independent.
Like, based on the problem.",High"
That is the assumption you are making.","
Yes, sir.",NA"Now, my question is, how will you find out if two features are independent or feature?","By P of A intersection B equals to P of A into P of B is not equals to P of A intersection B, then they are not independent.",Medium"So, what is A?
What is B?","
Is one probability of A and P of B is the probability of P?",Medium"You have two features.
Right?
Let us say two features are valid.
The number of hours you have studied for the Viva and the other feature is how much breakfast you have eaten.
And this is collected from all students.
What is A here?
What is B here?","
Hours of-studying is the A.",High"
So, many people have different hours of studying.
How will you, ?","
we will bin them.",High"Ok, then what will you do?","
Like, based on the, I will take certain threshold less than the hours as one and greater than the hours as one.
Like that I will find the probability.",Medium"
Ok, you will find the probability for each pin.
So, you will have some number of bins for one feature.
You will have some number of bins for the other feature.
They may be same, they may be different.
So, how will you find whether they are independent or not by probability?","
Sir, I will find the probability of one feature and I will find the probability of another feature.",HighCan you find the probability of the feature?,"Sir, based on the bins I will find the probability of the bin- So, total of hours.",Medium"Ok, then any other trick is there for finding out whether the features are independent or not.
","
Cosine-Similarity",NA"Right.
I do not know, you are just hesitating.","
Cosine-similarity",NA"Yes.
Using cosine-similarity, how will you find out whether they are independent or not?","If cosine-similarity like zero orthogonal, sir, we cannot say whether it is independent or dependent.
But if it is between zero and one, it is independent.",High"Good.
Very good.
How did the course go for you?","Well, ",NAwhat went well?,I learnt many things.,Medium"
Ok, how did I do?","Sir, of course, you do nice.",High"
Any feedback for me?",Nothing.,NA"
Thank you very much.",How did I do?,High"You did?
Fairly, ok. You have studied a lot of things.
But you have not thought on them.
You need to think and understand.","
Yes.",NA"
Only then you will be able to relate things.",Yes.,NA"Understand.
But that will also come with practice.","Yes.
Yes.",NAwhat is your project on ," So, our project is like mathematical questions in answers.
Like the marks will be given.",Medium"
Mathematical questions and answers
So, where marks are given.
",sir,NA"
So, what kind of problem is that?
Is that a clustering problem or?","
Yes, it is a regression problem.",HighRegression  problems.,"Yes, regression.",NA"Why do you think regression is the best model for that problem?
","So, like we are doing the embedding for that.
We will, it is a continuous data for us.
So, mam has given the continuous data and it is a like the marks what it is in integer data.
So, we are taking a math, code, and T pi.
So, similar to that using regression, mama has set to take RMS values.
So, for that, getting of RMS values, we have predicted that regression is best suited to that.
",Low"Okay.
Best suited because?","So, like when we are doing that, we are taking RMS, R square and MAP values.
So, based on consideration, we are first we are done it through 10 folds, like K fold map, K fold.
So, that we have taken K is equal to 10.
So, we have done 10 folds for that and for each fold we have calculated RMSC, MAP and R square values.
So, based on that we are, the RMS values, RMS values accuracy was given high.
So, we have taken that.
So, you did cross validation.",LowWhat is cross validation?,"Cross validation, like checking, checking between the accuracy and like for the training data set and the testing data set, the accuracy is similar and that one.",Medium"
That is cross validation.
Actually, you said you have done 10 fold cross validation like?",Yes sir.,NAWhat does it mean?,"So, I also asked, I also asked.
Like for the, each for the first generated value, it will be taking that one and it will be doing for that again.",MediumWhat does it mean?,"So, for like first an RMS value is calculated.
Means for that, for the next fold it will be calculated again.",Medium"
What is the next fold?
Okay.
Why did you do cross validation?
How does it help?","
So, for performing each values, when we are getting the 10th value, by taking the 10th value, like for each regression we are performed.
We are performed 10 folds.
So, for that from each to get which regression gives more value, for that we are done 10 fold it.",Low"Okay.
Right.
What is normalization of data?",like if the give data is..  to remove the null values and normalizing the data set.,Medium"
Yeah.
What is it?","So, like if any null values are present in the data set, removing those are to replace with mean or median.
And if there are any unnecessary words in the data set, it will be like removing those.",Medium"
So, removing unnecessary data and let's say, filling up null values is normalization.
Is that what u r saying?","
I don't know.",NA"Okay.
Then what do u get.",No idea.,NA"Okay.
You said you have used embedding.",Yes sir.,Why did you use embedding?,"
For conversion of the text data into numerical data.",High"
Converse of text data into numerical data.",Yes sir.,NAWhy is that needed?,"
So, like when we are using bird models to get more accuracy values we will be using it.",But if you don't do embedding what will happen?,"Sir, regression performance will be not needed",HighCan you do without embedding?,"no sir.
You cannot.",High"Yes.
Why not?","Because when supervised learning only numerical data is only continuous data is needed for this.
And the output variable should be in integer value.",Medium"
That is why you did embedding.
So, when you did embedding what was the vector dimension in generated?",Don't know.,NA"No idea.
Okay.
How did the course go for you?",It was not nice.,HighIt was not nice.,"It was quite nice.
It was nice.",High"Okay.
Any feedback for me,",actually you should keep on this,High"Not that.
That is different.
Now you have time to tell me.","No, sir.
Nothing.",NA"
Okay.
Thank you very much.",Thank you.,NA"Did you have breakfast?
So, what did you eat?
What are the different items which you are given in the next day?","They kept idli, upma and bread.",HighBustal is items.,That's it sir.,HighHave you taken it with water and salt?,"No, no, the chutney also will be there.
And they kept some puri.",High"Pudi chutney, idli, bread and upma.
Five items.
Suppose you are building a system which will look at the item and then put them into one of the five things.
Is that a classification problem or clustering or regressor?",Clustering.,NA"
Clustering.","The classification.
Clustering.",Medium"Sure.
Yeah.
Okay.
So, when item you are taking and looking at your item, someone will put it into one of the five things.
","Classification, sorry sir.",High"Classification sir.
Why do we say it is a classification problem?",Because on the similarity we will keep them into that class.,Medium"Similarity.
Okay, we will come to similarity.
So, is classification a supervised learning or a unsupervised learning?","
Supervised learning.",NAWhy?,"Like, for example, a supervisor learning is like for a machine, we are telling that do something by giving an example.",MediumYes.,It is a supervisor learning.,Medium"Oh, very good.
Wow.
Beautiful example.
No one has explained like that to me.
I am going to use that.
Okay.",I have one more example.,HighSure.,"
If a kid, we are going to teach him ABCD by showing him images.
That is also a supervisor.",High"So, he is a sewing and asking him to learn.
So, the kid is learning by looking.","Yeah, by looking.",High"Very good.
What does the model learn?",Model.,NAThe model is also looking at it and learning.,"
Yeah.",NA"What does it learn?
It takes an example of the model.
Let's say, let's say, this country.
What happens during learning?","
Like, it takes the…",High" Don't get tense.
You are doing perfectly fine.",It is building a tree based on the decision.,High"Very good.
How does it build a tree?","By looking at that classifications, it will be…",HighLooking into the classifications.,Based on the decisions.,High"
What decisions?","Like, based on..",High"When you are training your model, you are giving it a dataset.
Training dataset.
The training dataset is attributes and has a level.
And based on this information, the tree is getting constructed.
So, how does the construction happen?","
Like, first it will train",High"How?
I mean, train means what does it do to even training?",It will take the dataset.,High"It will take the dataset.
There is step one.
Then what do you let do?","For example, in our project, we are taking the audio and we are converting your text data.
And we are labeling it.
Like, we are doing like 70-70 trainings, 30-70 testing.
And then we are giving to the models and make them to learn.
They are trying it and then we are doing the testing.",High"Very good.
What happens during learning?
No.
Don't get tense.
Think and answer.",Not getting tense.,High"
It is decision-tree l linear classifier or non-linear classifier?","
decision-tree linear classifier.
Yeah.",HighWhy?,You cannot classify non-linear types like?,High"You cannot classify non-linear types.
What do you mean by that?
So, you have build a model.
For classification, how do you find out whether this model is a good model, properly built or not?
What do you look for?",Like for the accuracy.,High"
Accuracy.
And anything else?","
Accuracy, F scores.",NA"Abscores.
What does accuracy tell you?","
Like, if it is having the dimensionality lower, then accuracy will be high.
",Medium"Dimensionality is low, accuracy will be high.","Then, by accuracy, if the accuracy is high, then our model is perfectly trained.",High"
Which accuracy are you talking about?","
The training and testing accuracy.",High"Both.
You look at both.","If the training accuracy is something like 70s and testing also something like 70s, then it is like a regular fit.
Then, the model is perfect.
In our project, we are getting like overfit for training, we are getting 90s.
But in testing, we are getting something like 60s, 70s.
I was just overfitting.",Low"
More fitting.
What is overfitting?","Overfitting is like, it is a fully, the k value is too small, then it will be overfit.",Medium"k value.
You are referring to knn class value.
It is overfitting.
That is an example of when overfitting happens.
So, k value is small means what?","Only one sample.
If you are taking one sample.",High"No, what does it mean?
It means less training.
You are looking at only small data set.
Small data set leads to overfitting.
That is fine.
But what is overfitting?",Like a... ,NA"Don't worry.
So, what is normalization of data?","
Normalization of the form.",NAWhat is data normalization?,"Like, we are, if you are having the data.
If the data is not accurate, if you are not the correctly, we are going to normalize it and we are going to use that.
",Medium"What is normalization?
What do you do in normalization?","Like, if the...
If a normalization like, outliers... To reduce the outliers.
To reduce the outlet.",Low"To reduce the outlet.
How did the course go for you?",Nice.,NANice.,Good.,NA"
Good.
Why?
And how it went.
Which was, what was good?","
Like, your teaching is good.
Like, we can ask anything openly if you are adding any doubts.",Medium"So, how can I improve myself?
What do I need to do so that I can become better?","No sir, you are better, you are best sir.",High"So, you are not giving me any hints on how I can improve.","No sir, you are best.",High"Thank you very much.
One, thirty one.",,NADid you have breakfast?,No sir.,NA"Okay.What have you prepared, for Viva.",Try to brush through topics.,NAWhich topics you are most comfortable answering?,Most comfortable answering.,NA"
I don't guarantee I'll ask from them.
Just making you comfortable.","I...
There is KNN
We have the similarity indexes.
Similarity index.i means cosines sir. Similarity and distance those sir",Low,,Okay.What are the different similarity measures?,"Similarity measures.
As in the CH index, those sir.",High You only said similarity indexes.,"I mean, I'm not able to recollect formulas sir.
But then when we talk of similarity, what we are trying to do is how close to features are like not features.
Like cosine is there.
It's like we are trying to find the angle between two.
To find out how close they are.
Because if it is zero, they are in the same direction.
If it is again like one.
And then if it's a cos zero, it is perpendicular,orthogonal
And if it's minus one, there will be opposite directions.
Like ,yeah like that.",MediumCan you read the formula for cosine similarity?,Cosine similarity.,NA"What is the numerator and what is the denominator?
What is A?
What is B?",The vectors sir,NAWhat have you written in that denominator?,Root A *Root B,NAWhat is the Square root of a vector.,Square root of a vector.,NA"That is what you have written, right?","Yes, it's like the distance sir,basically",NA"Its like root of a root of a vector, is it?","No, it's not root of a vector.
Wait, distance is there.
No, above one.
There is something related to distance.",Medium"Okay, what is the numerator?",I thought it to be vector.,NA"Which one?
Numerator is vector.","
Then you normally cannot be…",NA"So, what have you written in that numerator?
A, B or A dot B or what is it?",Numerator is A dot B dot product.,NA"
A is a vector.
And what is B?",B is also a vector.,NA"So, what will be the dot product output?
Will it be a  vector or scalar?",Scalar.,NA"So, how does a scalar come out by the dot product of two vectors?","
I think it is there.",NA"You have A is a vector, B is a vector.
How do you get a scalar out of it?","Because we have two vectors, we multiply each other.",MediumEach point?,"
Yes, then you add them.",NA"Add them.
That is how it become a scalar.
Right, very good.
Now, can you tell me which classifier uses this concept?",The concept of similarity.,NAYes.,"
Similarity.",NAYes.,Not closeness.,NA"
How do you mean that?
Similarity is closeness or is there any different?","
Closeness is kind of same, but there is this difference.
It is not like they are exactly the same.
Similarity with respect, like... Like, we basically try to see the vectors or the features that we have.
With respect to...
If they are similar or not, we try to see they behave in the same manner or not.",LowCorrect.,"That is similarity.
And then the other one is closeness.
How close they are as in the KNN concept comes in there.",HighVery good.,"Just because they are close, doesn't mean that misclassification cannot happen.
Like, that is a different concept.
But, yeah, coming back to closeness, the vectors... they are ..Till a particular range, they can mean something.
Whereas, after a particular range, you can see the same features or the same items that you are seeing.
They can mean the same thing just because there are more number of ones nearer.
like a.. This is one range.
I have one chocolate here.
I have another chocolate of the same thing here.
And here inside, I have one one.
This is another chocolate.
So, inside here, there is again two chocolates, the second type.",Medium"
Right.","So, closeness is different.
And then, similarity with respect to if we see it, there are two different things.
We cannot combine them at a point.
Even though initially they seem similar.
That is how we are trying to remove the misclassifications, trying to make them different.
",High"Right.
What is my question?","
I don't know.
I forgot about that one.
That's my sorry.
Difference between closeness and similarity.",MediumNo.,No.,NAI have to... You have to write a concept of similarity.,"Simularity used.
Okay.
As in, in which model or…",HighYes.,"Okay.
Simularity is the way  we perform.Knn is closeness.. Ah....
Okay, and then, closeness.
I am not able to pinpoint on any one model, sir.",Low"No problem.
Can you tell me how do we reduce dimensionality?","Reduce dimensionality.
Dimensionality is like scaling down the features.
There are some methods to it, stolen class.
Yeah, there were some methods told in class, and I am not able to recollect it.",High"No problem.
Yeah.
So, how did you like the course?","It was good, sir.
More practical when compared to the other courses we came across still now, through the semesters.",HighAll courses are practical.,"They are practical, but then somehow theory kicks in a lot.
I am not telling you, you should not know the thing.
For example, now you are asking me theory.
I am taking a lot of time in collecting and all.
In most of the things, the theory used to be strong for every student or for me.
Because, practically I would not know how to do all projects and all.
But here, I think because of the labs itself, it started.","Okay.
Good.
What is your feedback for my improvement?",For your improvements?,NA"

Yes.","The way you teach is like engaging that is there.
There is more of how you interpret a thing.
So, that is good thing.
You are presenting different possibilities and telling the students.
So, they will pick up one one thing from it.
That is good.
And then, one more thing, I think there is too many formulas in this course.
I mean, generally there is a lot of mathematics in machine learning, starting from mean, standard deviation, all the linear algebra, matrix transformations.
There is a lot of mathematics.
But then, in the end, I feel like I do not remember any of the formulas I learned.
I wrote exams on it, but maybe for the exams beforehand, I read them.
So, I was able to recollect them and write that one thing was there.
But again, a few formulas, like a min max scaling, all those.
So, I think specifically, explain like this way we are trying to reduce it, like scale down.
When we are dividing it, like that, you were telling like that.
Those were very much into the brains.",Medium"
So I should not do that.","No, you should do that.
Then, we remember it better because we know what is happening and why it is happening.",High"So, you are saying that every formula, I should explain that.","That is the difficult thing to do.
But I think, I think theory wise may be a little more on that.
Otherwise, the next models and all the adaboost, all those things, stacking, ensemble, they were not really good.
I think ensemble was also taught by another senior.
That was good.
That class was good.
You can do that in future more.
Like, you can get other seniors to come and reach class.
They will feel more, because they have gone through the same thing, taught by you.
So, again, teaching in your class, same mentality will come in.
And that is nice.
But then labs again, it was good.
Labs were good.
But then, that is how we kickstarted our projects.
Or at least kickstarted how to do upon the different concepts practically.
But, yeah, like our case, I think just a few weeks ago, we tried to get an idea on what was happening, because we couldn't get a data set.
I think the topic was itself like that.
It took time for us to.
But the labs were there.",High,"So simultaneously labs were in happening.
The project was in happening.
Till midsim.
After midsim, all of us were able to like, understand.
It's not like we didn't know how to do stuff.
What the every lab, like even the lab six, like neural networks was the most difficult one.
It was like when you thought in the class or, you know, whoever thought in class, it was completely blank.
The same goes to lab.
Other classes, we were able to understand.
But starting from neural, it like, it happened in class, it happened in lab.
We don't know what happened.
I didn't know what happened exactly, because I was not able to understand anything in it.
But I had to do the lab on it.
And honestly, I submitted it in the morning, but I didn't know what it was.
Some things were like that.
But I guess on a overall, you try to cover everything up.",High"
Okay.
Thank you very much.",,NA" Okay, shall we start.",Yes sir.,NAWhat have you prepared.,"Sir, like I am good at classification and regression.
A decent enough ensemble and clustering.",High"Okay.
What is the difference between classification and regression?","So normally in our real life scenarios, we have two different types of predictions like.
Generally, if you want to predict that of two different types.
One is like if it take or example of our project like we are predicting trained delay.
That is a continuous value.
For that we use regression models.
And in other case, if you are predicting if the train is delayed or not delayed, then it is a classification.
Basically, in classification we have bins and we are putting in either that bin or there is bin.
But regression doesn't fall like that, it is a continuous value.",HighSo how do you measure errors of the model are a classification and that for a regression?,"Sir, for classification we have completely different error, like finding errors.
There we use a confusion matrix through which we can infer like precision, recall and sensitivity of the model.
So with these three standards, like performs metrics for classification models.
Where in confusion matrix generally we point like if an object is there, where it is plotted?
Is it like a true negative which means it is negative and it is plotted as negative?
True positive.
It is positive and it is plotted as positive.
And then false positive.
It is a negative value but model is predicting it to be positive and coming to false negative.
It is a positive value and it is being marked as positive negative.
But coming to regression, in regression we find the difference.
Like major point of like perform the matrix are used between differences.
Like in mean square error, we find the difference of actual value with the predicted value, then we square it.
We do summation then square, then root mean square.
We do the same thing is done under root, then mean absolute percentage error.
There also we find the difference, then we divide it with the number of attributes in the data.
And like that's we get the percentage.
Like we multiply it with 100 and we get the percentage value.
So like if I generalize things in classification it is more of like checking what it is and where it is put.
But in regression we are comparing like how deviated the value is predicted.",High"
Very good.
Very good.
What is the impact of data normalization on regression models?","Sir so these things early as we have discussed in class, like normally if I am working on a body mass index early, any such data where height and weight is given.
Generally in India we measure height in feets then with inches.
That's like around 5 to 6 is a decent enough range.
But for weight it's 50 to 60.
This number is very high.
50 to 60 weight.
And if I am training a model model doesn't know this is height, this is weight, this should be in this range, this should be in range.
So what it does it gives more priority to weight or in other hand it might give more priority to height irrespective of what it is.
And I others doesn't play a major role.
But in normalization what we do we get them into a similar scale so that model can understand like importance of both the features.
And another scenario is if the in regression if the values like the length of values is too high, if we are dealing with very big numbers, then it might be computationally inefficient to actually calculate all the values.
Instead we get it into a fixed scale.
Then if we perform values then again we can scale it by using mathematical operations.",High"Very good.
And what is  overfitting?","So overfitting.
Generally what happens is when we are training a model, due to various factors like due to more dimensions or like poor algorithm or like if the model is not properly learning.
The data which we feed in for training may not be enough for the model to properly predict.
So in that case when the data is in one statement when the data is less for the model to understand all the patterns and predict, that's in a day's called as overfitting.",MediumHow do you detect overfitting for regression?,"Sir, detecting overfitting for regression, this I am not so sure.
Like this can be once in a day.
Whenever if the error is too high, mean square error might be too high, like out of nowhere.
That can indicate that model is not learning properly.
That indicates that either model logic is not proper or the data can data which is fed in is not enough for the model to understand all the patterns.",MediumBut how will you detect it?,"Means square errors too high compared to like.
ah... I will just tell you that randomly if means square error is like coming in lakhs, no that case comes when a value is zero and when we are dividing it with you.
Or else error if errors are high, that can be considered as one case where model may overfit.",Medium"
If error is high is it overfitting?","
Not exactly sir, like.
That's what I am telling you sir, link.
Model is not performing well.
Overfitting is one of the causes for that.",Medium"Yes, but there could be other causes.",Yes sir.,NAso the question is how will you find out whether it is overfitting on not?,"
Can this scenario works or like mean square error is too high and RMS is like in plus.
There are outliers and outliers which are playing major like effect.
If we check for errors like the differences in values, few might give like 5, 10 and randomly one particular prediction have a difference of 50.
Then that means the model is not properly predicting for that thing which is completely increasing the means square error.like if we....",Highyou are explaining why overfitting leads to this?,"
Exactly sir, overfitting is leading to this means, link.
If this scenario occurs that means overfitting is there no sir.",LowBut how will you detect it?,"
I am not so sure.",NA"So you are justifying, okay, this is happening because of overfitting.","Yes sir,",NA" but the model is trained.
It is not coming and telling you that see I have gone for overfitting.
Now tell me why.",I am not so sure.,NA"
Okay.
Right.
And how does dimensionality affect?","Sir, like
Actually increasing the dimensionality is a very good thing but till one point.
At one point of time having unlimited like.., a number of dimensions does not make any sense.
It is increasing the burden on our model.
Like our model is sitting, it is finding so many other patterns.
Even if for example if I am predicting BMI, I know the formula of BMI, I give height, I give weight.
But I want my model to understand the formula.
And with height and weight if I give some random 10 other things like eye color, hair color, high living height, true size, if I give all these things, my model instead of focusing on these two important parameters, it is focusing on all other things and hence the output is not given properly.
And other thing is like computationally inefficiently storing that much data and processing on that high level data, it is not a feasible task.",Medium"
Okay.
So how do we reduce dimensionality?","Sir, we have filter methods, we have wrapper methods for that.
Filter methods are like statistical methods which have like forward elimination, backward elimination and forward backward elimination.
Where we add specific features, then we like that again depends on statistics.
All these filter methods are based on statistics.
Based on these statistics, we either pick the column or we drop the column.
Coming to wrapper methods, we find a subset, this subset is sent to model and based on the model performance.
This model is performing well, we will leave other things.
If model is not performing well, we will find other subset, we will send it to model again.",High"
Okay.
So how do random forest become a regressor?","
Like random forest, it is not exactly doing regression but it is categorizing things into bins.
Like the same classification model works but the regression in regression, it is making multiple bins and values are put into bins.",High"
How do we find the values into the bins?","That depends again on the data sir like.
If the values are completely spread and if there are no values between like.., for example, if 1000 to 1500, there are no values.
That means creating a bin in between does not matter.
So based on the data, number of bins are decided that can be done through hyperparameter tuning.
Ultimately, how spread the values are based on the bins are decided and bins are marked and values are affected.",High"
Okay.
How did the course go for you?","Compared to other courses, this course has the most practical approach.",High"
Any feedback from my improvement?
","
No, sir.",NAThank you very much.,"
Thank you.",NA What have you prepared for viva?,"
Well, project path, little bit as so and before I mid Sem and after mid Sem here and there.",Low"
So where should I ask you questions from?","I mean, Equation classification, clustering anything.
",HighAnything.,"I mean not anything but okay, we will see.",Medium"Right.
So tell me what are the difference performance metrics which are used for classification, regression and clustering and how do they how do they differ from each other?
","So classification, the performance metrics are basically accuracy, precision , recall, combination of precision and recall gives you F1 score.
I mean to regression ones, because there is variety of ones like this absolute error, mean absolute error, absolute error, then mean absolute percent error, then RMS that is root mean square error and kind of comparing, combining like R square score.
So here is R square score which is 1 minus RSS by TSS.
RSS stands for like the actual value minus predicted, then whole square.
And for TSS it is from the mean, actual minus mean, then the whole square.
So, and for classification, sir, I do not remember the exact names but like CH, index and SILURE, those things.
And how are they different?
So, in case of classification, we have predefined class, right?
So, accuracy, precision, these things tend to like find how much is correct in a set of how many.
things like this.
In regression, it calculates the error mainly.
Like how much error is we have from the actual value.
And in case of clustering, what happens is we tend to find a class separability by calculating the, mainly calculating the various distances between, I mean, with variances within the same class and inter-classes.
So, the more, the more, the more, the more distance between the elements of the same cluster and the more distance between class, two separate clusters, the better.
",Medium"Okay.
Right.
Now, suppose you have continuous attributes and they are in different ranges.",Okay.,NA"Do you think normalization of this data is going to change the outcome of K-means clustering?
","I mean, if we make the class normalization.
Okay.
Like, first of all, if there is specific ranges itself.
Those ranges can be clusters in themselves.
Okay.
But, if normalize, I am not so sure.
If you reduce to a separate range, then each element will be a cluster of its own kind of thing.
I mean, the class range also will get normalized, right?
So, should not affect as long as we define the cluster.
It does not work like that, but we will see how precise we find.",Medium"
Okay.
How do you reduce dimensionality?","So, sir, mainly there are three ways.
There are the principal component analysis, singular value decomposition, and LDS are full form, I forgot.
Linear discrimination.
So, what I mean, this PCA is, we first, so, at first, we standardize the data using the method like z-score or something.
Then, we create the covariance matrix from that.
Now, from the covariance matrix, we calculate the eigenvectors and values.
So, based on those, we make our new feature vector, and we organize the major higher dimensionality based on those axis itself.
That's how reduction happens in case of PCA.
It's 3D, it decomposes that matrix itself into three matrices.
How the mathematics work, but that I forgot.
So, SVG works.
LDS, I'm sorry, I don't know.",Medium"So, PCA, let's look at it.
Does it transform vector space?","
Hmm, that's something into.",LowFrom source to destination?,"I mean, if you look at it like based on three, because it's a high dimensionally, when we are getting into a matrix also, it does transform vector space.
",High"
Does PCA always reduce dimensionality?","
Most cases, yes.",HighCan you give one scenario where it doesn't?,"If, I mean, I won't, I can't give one example like that, but no, I can't.",Medium"You can't.
So, but it reduces dimensionality is what you are saying.",Yes.,NAHow does it reduce dimensionality?,"That's what I can't know.
At first, we standardized the whole data, maybe continuous or something like that.
Now, the creation of the co-variances.
Now, co-variances, we will get to know, right, like which is more dependent, which are more interlinked, and which are not that much interlinked.
So, that's what we are saying.
And based on that, the eigenvectors and values will easily tell us that, okay, this is the main, so that's how it, we can filter out the major features.",Medium"So, it is about selecting some features?","Mathematically, yes.",HighThen how is it different from feature selection?,"So, feature selection, okay, no, no, no, it's not feature selection, it's feature reduction.
But, what in feature selection what happens is, for example, if we take sequential forward, so, we test, right, on each of the feature, which gives the most accuracy, and then we select the feature, now in one selected, we can't reject it, and then, suppose there are k features, then after selecting one, the k minus one features left, we again perform the same procedure to see which one gives the best thing and select.
In case of backward, we reject the first time, like that.",High"That's the same thing you are telling for PCA?
","
No, no.",NA"Okay.
So, how is PCA different from this?","
So, PCA, we do not calculate this, what, what metrics is it giving, like, in the feature selection, we are seeing, like, this is the best accuracy we are getting for this feature.
PCA, we won't do any of those.
",Medium"So, then how do you decide which feature to re-keep and which one to reject?
","So, that depends on the eigenvectors now.
",High"How do the eigenvectors help you decide which feature to keep, which one to remove?","Based on the covariance matrix, so the eigenvectors are basically the whole thing, like, these are the most important features  like that.
",High"So, eigenvectors tell you these are the most important features.
What is the relationship between the original vector and the eigenvector?
",That mathematical thing I forgot.,Medium"
Okay, visualization wise?
","Mathematically I forgot visualization.
",Medium"Okay.
How did the course go for you?",Very well.,NA"
What went well?","
Like, what answer are you expecting, like, what kind of one?",High"
I don't know.
I mean, if you say that, okay, the course was fine or well, why do you say it is well?","
Because in your classes don't you?",Medium"
Like, someone said that you didn't trouble us, so it is well.","No, no, no, no, not like that.",HighThen like what?,"In that scenario, I can tell the first quiz.
That was unfair in some ways.
Okay.
I would say it went well because when I listen to your classes, okay, like, I understand.
Like, I, even for exams, if I read the notes I wrote, I can understand things.
But other things it might not affect.
",Medium"Okay.
Any feedback for me?","
No, not really.",High"
Thank you very much.",Thanks,NAWhat is your project about?,"So my project is like we find the impact of non-code text in the code block text, in the code blocks, like how they affect the execution time and whether there is a difference between it or not, that is it.",High"Okay, is there a classificum problem or is there some problem?",It is a regression problem.,HighWhy?,"So like in regression, we are clearly able to point out which parameter affects the target variable properly.
In the clustering, we won't be able to make it error properly.",Medium"I am not talking about cluster.
Why is it not a classification problem?","Sorry, classification.
In classification, it is either this or that.
So we don't be able to tell it 100% affects the code block or it 100% does not affect.
But in regression, we can tell that we have 4 data sets.
We can tell that which affects the least and that will help the user or the individual understanding better.",High"
Okay, is a regression a supervised learning problem or a unsupervised learning problem?",Sir regression is supervised.,HighWhy?,"So because you are giving all the parameters and making the model learn according to it.
You are teaching the model.
You are telling the model you have to learn this and then failing them.",HighYou have heard of what are parameters and hyper parameters for a model.,"Sorry, sir.",NAParametricers and hyper parameters.,"Yes, sir.",NA"
So let's take an example of a regression.","
Okay, sir.",NAWhich all regression have you use?,So we have you linear regression or XG Ada boost.,Medium"
XG boost?","Ada boost,",NA"Ada boost.
Okay.
So let's take linear regression.
What are the parameters and what are the hyper parameters","So hyper parameters is the k value, ",Highk in linear regression.,"That's good.
Sorry.
In regression, the parameters are going to my project, sir.
Or just in general.
Yes, sir.
In regression, the parameters will be there is a target variable according to which the parameters will be decided and taken into constant predict how the target variable behaves.",MediumWhat is the parameter here?,Parameters are the columns which include the data that affect the target target column prediction.,HighSo the features of the parameters you are saying?,These are taken into consideration by the model to evaluate the target.,HighAnd what is hyper parameter?,Hyper parameters are predefined learning and not sure.,High"Okay.
How do you measure the performance of a regression model?","So we calculate the various like MSE, R square and similar matrix which we can be valid in the after-week of the model.
That's how we evaluate them.",High"
So when you write the formula for RMSC, it means square.","
So I forgot.",NA"You forgot.
Okay.
No problem.","
But I do know how it what happens.",High"Okay.
Tell what happens.","
Like first, first we calculate the mean square error.
So that is basically calculating how error varies from each column.
And it's called error variance.
We calculate.
And then after we calculate the MSE, we root it.
That is RMS square error.",High"
Okay.
Let's say there are three actual values.
One, five, seven.
I am very liberal.
And the predicted values are there.
Like three, two, seven.",Okay.,NA"
So what would be the RMSC here?","Two, three and zero.",NA"That will be RMSC.
Do you get one RMSC for each value?","
No, sir.
No, sir.",NA"
MSE?
Okay.
You talked about boosting regressors.",Yes.,NAWhat are boosting regressors?,"So boosting regressors are basically like the sequentially trained weaker models to get better according to the previous models weaker outcomes.
Like the sequential train of weaker model.
Let's say model X1.
In model X1, there is a weak instance coming out.
That weak instance will be given more weight in the next model to be trained.
So that it gets better.",HighHow do you give that more weight?,It's automatically given.,NAHow?,I am not aware.,NA"Okay.
So how many steps you will follow in a boosting?","Until we get a desired value.
It depends on how much accurate, like boosting use for improved model performance and accuracy.
So until we get a desired accuracy, keep going.",Medium"Yes, there is a regressor problem.
How will you find accuracy?
Let's say, given this example, can you calculate accuracy?","I can see it's just Tp plus,",High" find it?
How is this?",This is the prediculous.,MediumOkay.,"It's just 1 by 3, sir.",High"
How?",Because it's just predicting 1 value for the most accurate.,High"
So you are saying in the model, it's 33% accurate.","Okay.So the confusion may take some order to be delayed.
There's a…",Medium"Okay.
How does the dimensionality affect the regressor?","
Dimensionality reduces the accuracy by using regression.
So it's better to reduce it using various methods like PC and ULMAP.
To get better at it.",HighHow do you reduce dimensionality?,"
Using methods like PC and ULMAP.",High"
Will you explain how PC helps reduce dimensionality?","
Yes.
So in PC, it...it...it...cafesates again the variance of certain components and the thing.
And the...most among...it will be greater among variance, which has the highest variance, which is like comparatively lesser.
It shifts everything automatically to an axis.
And according to that, the dimensionality is reduced and square-period.",Low"Okay.
How did the course go for you?","
So I like this.
I may not be able to answer this, but at that point of time, like accuracy, when...my term was that I was able to do it very well.
I just forgot.
I didn't expect that we had to suppose to write out formalizing next.",Low"
Okay.
And you could back for me.","
I'm not sure.
I...missed a lot of classes so I still want to.
Because whenever I was there, I liked it.",Medium"
Thank you very much.","
Thank you so much.",High Sorry?,After the regression.Regress some models.,MediumWhich is there a specific model which you have prepared?,Only the KNN and KNN regression.,HighK&N? When does overfitting happen in K&N?,"Sir, in the KNN when the K-value is too low, then overfitting happens because of the closeness is predicted very closely so that every mass type of mispredector either yes or no.So it becomes the overfitting when the K-value is too low.",HighCan you explain why it becomes overfitting when you open?,"Sir, if the K-value is very less, the distance between the two values would be more lesser.
So each neighbor is closely, closeness is too much and the bias is too high and the variance is too low.
So it is overfitting.",MediumCan you tell me one scenario where KNN cannot be used?,"When the data is too large, when something like to find the student from AUMS data, it is very difficult without any parameters like whether the department or specifications mention.
So when the data is too large, find accurate.",MediumAre you saying finding student in AUMS is a scenario where KNN cannot be used?,Yes.,NAIs that what you are saying?,Yes.,NA"But why would a how does KNN is a classifier?
How does finding a student become a classification problem?","Sir, based on the classification, we can categorize the student listness.
Whether it is a CSE or whether it is an ESE, so that finding would be easier when the classification is more easy.",High"Again, can you please help explain?","If the classification is mentioned like CSE or ESE, then the student can be identified more easily.
Without the mentioning whether it is a CSE or ESE or some other branch, it is more difficult to find the student with the same name.",Medium"Yeah, but if it is already mentioned, then how are you doing classification? Then becomes an attribute, right?","Yes. And if it is an attribute, that is not a class level.
So without any class features, then it would be more harder to apply KNN.",HighBut isn't that true for all classifiers?,No.,NA"How not? If attributes are not there, how any classifier would work?","The raw data was the student name list is there.
From that list, you have to find specific student",MediumSo then what is the problem?,"The data would be too large, so it would be difficult to find the same name with the name Sriram.
Then, identify people can be 4 to 5.",MediumSo accuracy would be less,no sir. Finding the actual person with the same details.,HighYou are saying that attribute vector for multiple instances belonging to different classes are same.,Yes sir.,NA"So that becomes a problem.
And clean.",Yes sir.,NA"Is there any classifier which is existing?
Which can solve this problem?
Don't you think you will have the same problem with every classifier?",Yes sir. Then it should have the specific labels and the target of this.,MediumIt needs to.,Yes,NASo then do you think that is the right scenario where can and cannot be used?,No sir.,NAWhat do you do and values are missing?,"If the values are too very much .
If the values missing were too high, we can replace with the, when the values are missing too high, we can replace with zero.
Or we can replace with the mean values.",MediumSuppose the values are categorical.,"If the values are categorical, we can convert into the labels from the labels, from the labels, calculating the mean values. So placing the mean value with the missing value.",MediumWhat is it called as?,encode. Contitute to the code.,LowSo what are the different encodings you know?,"One hot encoding and embeddings P5. Embeddings.
Defendments.",HighSo say let us say you have built a classifier. How will you measure whether the classifier is a good one or not a good one?,"If the classifier is having the accurate label values either some 3 to 4 labels, which means yes or no, either somewhat other options. If the each and every data is getting labeled, then the data would be more correct and can be more easily processed.",High"Yeah, but how will you measure it?
What is generalization?
So it is having in the bond or whether finding all the labels are present or not?",It is generalized.,High"How did you find the course?
How did it go for you?",Yes sir. Good.,NAAnd if it bad for me?,"No sir.
We thought to interact more sir but we were somewhat tense to ask everything.",HighWhy?,No sir.,NAWhat did I do to make you tense?,"I sent my students in the starting.
If the assignment is missing then it is punishment to write.",MediumPunishment to write what?,At 10 times or 20 times you have mentioned this to write again.,MediumSo by why? That is for missing.,Yes sir.,NANot for interacting right?,Yes sir.,NA"Anyway, I wish you good luck for your next semester.",Yes sir.,NAThank you very much.,Okay sir.,NA105 right?,Yes sir.,NA" So, which concept or module are you most comfortable for Viva?","KNN.
A bit of basics of regression and clustering also.
I studied.",Mediumyour project is a character recognition project.,No. sir. We are predicting BIS values using..,High"Then you are in night colours.
Night colour project is segmentation for your character recognition.
Who are your teammates?","Vishnu Pavandata, Yogendra.
Yogendra Vinash.",High"Okay, fine.
So, is that a regression problem or a classification problem?",That's a regression problem.,HighIs regression a supervised learning or unsupervised learning?,It's a supervised learning.,MediumWhy did you choose a regression problem for your project?,"This was a bit different.
Predating BS values.
There is no value in it.
That's why we inspired.",Low"No, no, no.
I am not asking your project.
I am asking.
Why is regression the most suitable?","Because BS values are dependent.
Regression is finding the final relationship between dependent and independent variables.
So, BS values is dependent on the drug and fusion rate of proper phenyl aromantinol.
So, these are independent and BS values are the independent.
So, we are finding the BS values.
So, it is dependent.
So, that's the target.",Medium"So, very good.
So, how do you measure a regression model?
What are the performance metrics used for regression model?","We can use RMSC, MSC, MAP, accuracy.",High"Accuracy, you can use.","No, accuracy.
We can use these three and...
I am sorry.
M-A-E also.",Medium"Very good.
So, which one should U should use  and why",Sir.,NA"I mean, okay, you said M-A-C, RMSC.","Yes, sir.",NAAre there any problems with M-A-C and RMSC?,"Sir, like M-A-C, if you take more, the difference between the value, if suppose if one is small and the other is large, the difference will be more as it's... We have to square and we are finding the difference between the square.
So, the difference will be large.
So, then it will be tough to predict the value.",HighOkay.,"So, yes, sir.
And RMSC also, we are doing the root of the M-A-C.
So, then also the problem, like it reduces the M-A-C, but still there will be a problem, sir, as the difference can be large.
So, it might impact the model, sir.",MediumHow do you find outliers in data?,"Outliers, like plotting wise, we can use box plot and all, sir.
I don't know, sir.
Like plotting wise, I only know using plotting, sir.
We can use box plot and then we can find out the outliers.",MediumWhat do you do when there are a lot of missing values in your data?,"Sir, firstly we can remove the empty rows.
First, or else we can imputations, or we can fill those values with the mean, median or the modes, sir.
Like if it's categorical, sir.",Medium"You will fill them by mean, median and mode.","Yes, sir, if it's categorical, we can fill by means.",HighOkay.,"And if it is not categorical, we can fill by mean or means.
Average also, as well as statistical, average and all, sir.
Yeah, mean is our sorry, sir.",LowWhat is the difference between mean and media?,"Sir, median...
Okay, mean is the average of the entire value, sir.
Average and, I mean, some of all divided by the total number, sir.
And then is the most repeated one, sir.
Now, mode is the most repeated one, median is the middle was value of the... ...data, sir.",Low"You said that for numeric values, you can... ","Yeah, sir, I was wrong, sir.
Sir, sorry sir sir",Medium"You said for numeric values, you can use mean and median.","New numeric values, sir.",High"You have two options, which one will you choose?
And why?","I will choose median, sir.",HighWhy?,"Because, let me...
Example, you take, sir.
One, two, one...
I mean, two and four, sir.
I don't know, actually.",MediumOkay.,"Two and ten, sir.
Two to ten, sir.
If you do the average, you will get a... Like, sir, it's still...
It's dependent on the addition of the values, sir.
So, it... Like, we might get a large value while doing the mean, sir.
As, if there is a large number in that data set, I mean, sir, if there is a large value, it can impact the data, it can impact the mean, sir.
Like, the addition, the sum might impact, and...
Overall, the mean might impact, sir.
Like, the median, it won't impact.",Medium"Okay.
That is why you will use mean.","Yes, sir.",NAHave you heard of what is called data normalization?,"Yes, sir.
Like, there are three types, like... Min-max normalization, Z score, and decimal scaling, we can use these three normalizations.",HighLike... Why do we do the normalization?,"So, to get all the values in a set of...
In a particular set of intervals, sir.",MediumWhy is that important?,"Like, if there are outliers and all, then it will impact the outcomes, sir.
The way... Outcomes.
So, that's why, if we normalize the data, we get a particular set of intervals, and then we can predict the values properly, sir.
But... We get a predefined interval, sir.",Medium"But even in the changed range, outlier continues to be an outlier, right?","Yes, sir.
Outlier can still be outlier.
Yes, sir.
It will be outlier, sir.
But the impact might...
It will be outlier.",LowWhy do you say that?,"Because we are bringing a set of intervals, sir.
So, that's why, sir.
Like, if there... Sir, if you think all in between one and ten, sir, all the values, there is one value, which is hundred, sir.
So, if we get all the values...
If all the numbers between one and ten, if we scale it down to one and ten, then this will also come down, sir.
If it is decimal scaling, then all will come in point numbers, like, in decimal...
In decimalization of 0.12, like that, but hundred will come down to ten, sir.
So, it will drastically go down, sir.
Just come down, sir, I mean.",Medium"And, what do you think about dimensionality of data?
Is high-dimensional in some good or bad?","For what, sir?",HighHigh-dimensional. You are using feature vectors.,"Okay, okay.
High-dimensionality. No, sir.
High-dimensionality is not good.",High"Why do you say it is not good?
What kind of problems can it cause if the dimensionality of the data is very high?","I am not getting...
I don't know what it is.",MediumHow do you reduce dimensionality?,"We can use methods of PCA, like, yes, we can use... No, SVD, sir.
We can use SVD for reducing the dimensionality.",MediumWhy should SVD reduce dimensionality?,"I don't know, sir.
I am...
I am confused between SVD or PCA…",Medium"Does it matter?
Why should both of them reduce dimensionality of data?
Why?","It might create outliers for further... Or feet.
Like... Sir, then... Like, then the model can run easily, so that's why we reduce the data",LowHow the model will run easily?,"Like, removing the dimensionality, which are unnecessary, and we are keeping the which are required.
So, hence it can... Like, then it can train properly and smoothly.
And we can predict the value of the circuit.",Medium"Correct.
But why should PCA be able to reduce dimensionality?","PCA...
I don't know, sir.",HighHow did the course go for you?,"Good, sir, yes.",NAWhat was good about the course?,"Like, I got to know... Like, initially before taking this course, I have no clue about what... Like, how is it like AI and all, sir?
And now I have an idea about AI and how machine learning works.
Like, senior students, to speak about these models, I don't know what the model is.
Now I have an idea.
So, yes.
I have an idea now I can do... Like, I'm interested in further work to know, sir.
Good.
I got to know the basic understandings of ML.",Medium"Good.
So, any feedback for my improvement?",No.,NAYou can tell the problem of it.,"No, sir.",NAThank you very much.,"Thank you, sir. Like, how was the ?
Was it okay?",Medium"Good, very good.",Thank you very much.,NA"The roll number is 10, right?","Yes, sir.",NAWhat is your rule number?,112,NAWhat is your project?,Train delay prediction.,NAWhat kind of problem is it?,"It's a regression based problem.
Regressions.
Yes.",MediumIs regression a supervised learning or unsupervised learning?,It's a supervised learning.,HighWhy?,Because we have a label which is predefined based on which we are predicting the values.,MediumHow does the label help you?,"Sir, the label is like a target upon, like we have our training which is done to predict the target.",Medium"So, why is that become supervised?","Sir, because in unsupervised we don't have any labels.
Basically, it's just random data points which are being classified into different clusters or different algorithms.
But in supervised sense we have something based on which we are predicting.
That becomes supervised.",High"How does the, let's say you have missing values in that data.
How do you feel?","Using imputation methods like if you have continuous numbers we can use either mean or median based on if you have outliers or not.
If you have categorical variables we can use more.",High"So, when you do this input lesson techniques with central tendency, how does it affect the training of your model in regression?","It helps the model perform better because when there are missing values the model tends to give like it gives better accuracy like not accuracy.
Like the performance becomes better, sir.",MediumHow and why?,Because when we are training we have a fixed number of vectors and if there is some missing value in the vector the algorithm might not perform properly.,HighWhy?,Not sure.,NAHow does dimensionality affect your regression model?,"The number of dimensions depends on how the output comes like.
Like more number of dimensions might sometimes lead to less number of dimensions might lead to underfitting.
Like selecting the proper number of dimensions is important so that we get proper results out of the model.",MediumYou have heard of -colp courses of dimensionality.,Yes sir.,NACan you explain any one of them?,"That's what I like. That's what I like.
More number of dimensions which can lead to overfitting",LowMore dimension leads to overfitting.,Yes.,NAWhy?,"Because when the model is training it tends to learn very much towards the training set that it won't be general so that when we give the test set or new data to the model it will be hard for the model to predict because it has trained with more dimensions and it is like trained for the training set.
Whereas when we give a new data set it will be hard for the model to predict the values.",HighBut that didn't get justified.,"Every model trends on the training set.
Yes sir but it is like very much likely towards the training set.
When we give new data set it won't be generalised for the new data set.",Medium"Correct.
But how does dimensionality bring this in?",Sir when we increase the dimensionality it leads to overfitting and the overfitting condition leads to the current situation.,Medium"Understood.
My question is all about why is high dimensionality leading to overfitting?
What is the reason behind dimensionality being high leading to overfitting? Understood my question?","Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes.have more number of variables to predict",LowIs it?,like No more …,MediumIn your training relay experiment how many variables are you predicting?,One. Like a prediction is one but training is happening on one number.,MediumCorrect.,Yes sir when increase the number of variables the while testing the errors my also increase because of that test.,Medium"How do you reduce dimensionality?
By using different feature selection methods like PCA or how does PCA help you reduce dimensionality?",By using different feature selection methods like PCA ,Highhow does PCA help you reduce dimensionality?,Sir it checks like which column is providing more benefit towards predicting the target variable and which is providing less and based on that we can remove that which are not so useful in predicting the value,MediumThat is feature selection not PCA.,It uses the eigenvectors based on that rule it tells us like which vector is helping the thing like predict better.,HighHow does an eigenvalue or eigenvector tell which feature is important for predicting the output?,"So like when we project those eigenvalues we can see that like when we project the eigenvalues the vectors like which tend to overlap on each other.
Like that means that it's not giving like a better like it's not helping give a better result.
So those things can be removed and then the rest of the things can be used for the prediction.",MediumAre you sure what you are telling?,Not exactly. I know that it uses eigenvalues and then projects but after that part I'm confused.,MediumWhat did the course go for you?,The course was very nice.,HighWhat was nice about the course?,Like the way of teaching like most of the concept I was able to understand in the class itself that made me for learning it a little later.,MediumAnd any feedback for my improvement?,"No sir.
It's like the whole course of the great.",MediumThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA"One, one, two.",Yes sir.,NA What have you prepared?,Before mid-term ... it was good .,Highwhy did you not prepare anything from after mid-term?,"Actually, I didn't revise anything, I was at the hospital.",High"You were at the hospital?
Yesterday.","Yesterday?
Yesterday, day before yestarday.
Yesterday, I came to hostel again and went to hospital.",Low"
Why? What Happen","I have asthama sir.
I have a cold.",High"So, you are comfortable with your mid sem?",sir..,NAYou are comfortable with your mid sem?,Yes.,NA"So, tell me, what is the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?
","
In supervised learning, we give inputs and outputs.
We give inputs and outputs.
When we give inputs, we even map it to the outputs.
We give it how we want the outputs to be got but in unsupervised, when we use inputs, the machine is trained to predict the outputs based on outputs.",Medium"Can you give an example of the problem scenario where you can use unsupervised learning?
","
Example is predicting the weather condition.",Medium"
Can you be a little more specific?
What do you mean by weather condition?","Like, we give weather reports every day and we train the model every day by giving weather reports.
We give the weather reports every day and we try to predict the weather.
The conditions of the weather today like it is sunny and cold and we predict what kind of weather it is.",Medium"So, that is unsupervised learning.
Why do you call that unsupervised learning?","
Because it is not supervised learning.",High"Can you name one algorithm which is unsupervised?
So, in your weather prediction example, let us say you have built a model which will predict the weather.
Like temperature or rainfall, how will you measure the output of this model?
Whether the model is doing good, not good, how will you measure it?","
like ah.. if it matches with anything before we given …",Low"Okay.
Can you tell me what is the difference between mean and the median?",Median is the central value of the all values given.,High"
And mean?",Mean is the average .. Average,High"
What is the difference?","In median.
ah.. We arrange the values in the order.in mean we dont.",High"Okay.
So where should we use which one?
Can the two values be same?
Can the two values be different?",yes sir. ,NA"Sure.
100% always.",Not always sir.,NA"Okay.
Can you tell me when they will be same and when they will be different?","Okay.
The median might be different when they are outliers.",High"Okay.
So when do you use median?",Find the .. center values.,HighHow did the course go over you?,Very good.,"Good.
What does good about the course?",So how are you doing?,HighIs there any specific aspect you like more?,"Actually I was more consistent with the classes and was listening and starting later.
I was a bit afraid.",HighWhat is your feedback for me?,sir good sir.,High"
Thank you very much.","
Thank you.",High"Please close the door.
Thank you.
What have you prepared?
What should I ask you?","Until mid-term portions tharough, but I am prepared well, but after mid-sem I went through.",MediumWhy what happened after mid-sem?,"
I have a FDS project as well.",HighYou had FDS project for which you didn't study M.L.,"No, sir.
I went through concepts, but I couldn't study it.",HighWhich concepts you went through ,"from mid-term, like neural networks?",HighWhat do you know about neural networks?,"So, neural networks, it's like as we have, first say generally in brain we have many neurons.
Like suppose something happens, they all simulate to work together and give an output like we touch something on.
So, even when we consider that in M.L.
it applies to same.
Like we have set of inputs, we have first we randomly assign some weights, and then we have a summation function which will sum all the inputs.
And then we have specific functions which we can change it accordingly.
Based on that function it gives the output, and then after we get the output, we calculate the loss functions, I mean derivative of the target variable.
Then when we get the derivative, then we can reassign the weights based on the output we are able to use.",MediumHow do you calculate the derivative of the function?,"The loss functions on the value, that loss value,",High"when an input is going, it is generating an output.","Yes, ",NA"so from the output, output is generally a number which is generated.
How do you calculate the derivative from this number?",I am not really sure.,HighOkay. What is an activation function?,"What is an activation function?
As a specified, there is a specified function which we can choose, that is activation function.
We can choose any of the functions which we want.
Like ...For example, we can tell it as application based.
So, on application based, we can choose whatever function we want to model from input to output.",HighLet us say you have emails coming in.,"Yes sir, and the function is to specify whether it is a spammer or not.",High"You have emails coming in and based on the content of the email, you have to put it into the enquiry division or to the support division or to the payment division.
So, what kind of activation function would you use?
","Containment content.
I don't know sir.",HighCan you name any activation function?,No.,NAWhat are the support vectors?,Support vectors. Not quite sure about it.,High"How is the decision tree constructed?
","
Consider we have some problem statement.
Suppose a model, we have to, the stationary will be considered from start.
Let consider should be approved alone.
First, the decision tree is constructed, based on first.
If the person employed or not, then the other part of the stationary will continue with the consequences based on that.
Then the correct part of it, the other part of it will have the, if the person is employed, then will he income, will he income is less or more?
So, based on the attribute we can say, it is constructed based on that.",Medium"Okay.
But given the attributes, how will you construct?
Is there some specific step you will take to construct?
You are giving me a conceptual answer.",Specific step.,High"
What is the first thing you will do from the attributes?","
We will find out the most important attributes.",HighHow?,"
Correlation analysis.",NAHow will you do Correlation analysis?,"
sir ,We calculate the interdependencies of the attributes.
Or we can put it in a way that how is the attribute?
I mean, change in one attribute, how is it affecting the other attribute?",High"
That is Correlation.",Yes sir.,NA"Between the attributes.
Okay.
So, how will you identify which attribute is giving up more to the output?",I am not getting any thought of that.,Medium"
How does a Bayesian classifier work?","Bayesian classifier.
I mean, I don't know about Bayesian classifier.",HighHow is K&N usually a regressor?,"KNN.
Used as regressor sir?",HighYes.,"Okay.
So, K&N.
So, instead of classification, human regression, we are trying to find a, we are using it as approximation function.
Like, we are trying to predict something.
Maybe using the weighted KNN.
We are giving the weights of the target variable based on that we can use it as a KNN as regressor.",HighHow?,"Here, in the normal, we are just classifying it.
But regression comes to regression.
We are not, we just don't have to, we are not supposed to classify, we are supposed to estimate something.
Based on the average, maybe instead of just choosing one which is most repeating, like say, for which K&N, maybe we can do the average and use it as a regression.","
Average of KNN.","
No sir the distance.",High"
Average of distance is the output.
Average of distance of what?","Between two points,",High" which two points,","which two points.., the attributes which are giving you,",Medium"
 two points, we will have one distance.
What do we mean by average of distance?","For say, I have some, for one attribute, I have some six instances.
Let's say my dataset has only two attributes, two or three, but with six instances.
I am finding the distance between each point of the one attribute to the other, with each point of the other attribute.
I am considering each as a vector and then I am finding the distance between them using equilibrium distance.",Low"Okay
How did you find the course?","
sir..",NAHow did you find the course?,"
I found it difficult in the starting.
Then, what kind of helped me is ?
is like, Ppt was not given.
Maybe if Ppt was given, I would have just learned from it.
Since Ppt was not there, I had to go to websites and read it in all the preparation.
That kind of used to help.",Any feedback from me?,"No, nothing sir.",NA"Please sit down.
Did you have breakfast?",Yes.,NAWhat did you have for breakfast?,orange.,NAAnd what did your friends have for breakfast?,"One of my friends had curd rice, I don't know what the other friend have.
",Medium"So let's say you go into a restaurant, there are many items on display.
And you are trying to build a system where from the camera it is capturing what all items you are picking.
And then it will really be appropriately.
So this is identifying which items you are picking, what kind of problem this is.","I identify what kind of problems I am.
So sir that should be classification because each food item you pick will correspond to a particular cuisine.
So whatever picture it takes it will drop it into one particular bucket of cuisine.",High"That is why it is classifications.
Good.
And so you are able to identify what problem it is.
So tell me whether classification is a supervised learning problem or a unsupervised learning problem.","So classification you are doing based on labels, so it is supervised.
",HighWhy it is called supervised?,"So based on the labels you are classifying based on a particular cuisine, say in the restaurant scenario.
So you know what your classes are.
So if a new data set or if a new data point comes based on the label you just classify it into that particular bucket.
So that is why it is supervised.",High"Okay.
So once you do your classification how will you measure which model is good?
How will you measure and evaluate?
There are lots of classifiers.
So you may have to experiment with different classifiers to find out which is the most suitable classifier for a given scenario.
So how do you measure it?","So you have various evaluation metrics like a confusion matrix precision recall, or training accuracy testing accuracy etc.
So based on that we can check which has a higher accuracy and we can see which is a more suitable model.",High"Okay.
So now as you said that you have training accuracy and test accuracy.
How do you pick which model?
You are saying whichever has maximum accuracy.
Now for each model you have now two accuracy.
So they can create a lot of conflicting scenarios.",I didn't get you so.,High"So for example you can have one model where that training accuracy is very high, test accuracy is low.
You can have another model where training accuracy is low, test accuracy is high.","So we usually look at the testing accuracy because that is where you are testing your new data points.
So if that is high we basically consider that model is more suitable.",High"Then why do you calculate training accuracy?
Why you waste complete tests and for something you don't need?",So you can find the relationship between the training and the testing how far they are related to each other so that you can see whether they are over fit or under fit conditions.,HighWhat is over fit and what is under fit?,"So in over fit like in a KNN scenario if the K values are too small that means your data points are situated very close to each other.
So it's not it's like too specific.
You can't really make a lot of you cannot actually make a lot of true predictions or classification.
Because it's like too specific you cannot the value might not be true to the whole data set.
Where is in an under fit condition the values are too generalized.
The accuracy between your training and your testing might be too close to each other.",MediumAccuracy between training and testing sets will be too close to each other that will be under fit and in over fit.,It would vary.,HighIt would vary in what?,I believe the training accuracy would be much more than the testing accuracy.,High"Then it is over fit.
Why does over fit happen?",So maybe when the models are like when the data points are too similar to each other in that case is overfitting might happen.,High"Which data points are too similar to each other?
Training data points or test data points?",Not too sure.,High"Okay no problem.
What is the impact of dimensionality on overfitting or underfitting?","Okay.
So I am not too sure about dimensionality because dimensionality I don't think it depends on the number of data points you take.
It is about converting, say a higher matrix, say a 20x20 matrix and do scaling it down to something smaller.
So I am not too sure about what impact it has on an overfitting or underfitting model.",High"You said something about 20x20 matrix getting reduced to something smaller.
What does it mean?","So you are basically scaling down something really huge to something that can be calculated which can be much easier to test upon a calculator.
You are scaling down the values.",High"
So you are scaling down the values means the face value of the values or the number of values?",We are not scaling down the number of values.,HighYou are just scaling down the face of the values.,Yes,NA"Like five can go to two like that.
But if there are let's say 10 features it will continue to remain 10 features.",yeah,NA"
And that is related to dimensionality.
And then what is scaling?
Normalization.","So normalization is if there is a large range of values you are bringing it down to a shorter range of values.
That you are scaling down the values to a smaller range.",High"That is what you explained earlier.
What are the different normalization techniques you are aware of?","
min-max , z score normalization.",NAWhat is the difference between these two?,"So Z score normalization takes an account the mean and standard deviation of the particular data set.
Whereas when min-max normalization it first takes the starting and the ending point of the initial range.
And then you will have to if you want to scale it down to a smaller range you take the other values and good.
I do not remember the exact formula but you play around with the mean and the max point",High"So what would be the mean and standard deviation of the data?
Turn mean max normalization.
",Sir I believe if it is if the mean of the original is 5 after min max it might reduce to a 2.5.,HighThat is mean or standard deviation?,The mean.,NA"What about standard deviation?
Will it remain same increase or decrease?","The standard deviation I believe won't differ too much because it is not dependent on the mean.
It depends on the variance.",High"
The standard deviation depends on the range of the data?","I don't.
I don't think so.",Medium"Okay
How did the course move for you?","It was good sir.
I got a lot of things.",High"
Which aspect of the course was good for you?","I really enjoyed doing the volunteering part.
I really liked learning the concepts and how we were practically testing doing things based on our own project data sets and everything.
We were doing practically and at the same time I was able to learn a lot of concepts with this good.",MediumAny feedback for my improvement?,I don't think so sir.,High"You are a CR also.
So maybe you would have collected some inputs from the class.
So maybe you can convey.","I think initially when you asked them to submit the lab reports every week they found that a little bit serious.
So maybe that can be reduced.
",High"Suppose it is reduced.
Will it help you learn?","No sir.
I mean the report part because we weren't really at least for our project.
We weren't really sure of what was happening in the beginning.
Because we had a lot of problems with that data set and doing the feature extraction and everything.
So we weren't really sure about what exactly to add.
We weren't able to create a proper report as such.
So that's why we found a little difficult.
",Medium"I understand.
But my question is when I am asking you to do something there are multiple aspects of learning.
So suppose I don't ask you to do that.
Will there be learning?
","No it's not about the report part was fine but I felt if the number of reports could be reduced like not every week, maybe twice a week.
Consolidate of what we did until then that would be more helpful.",High"
Okay thank you very much.",,NA 120 roll number right .,yes sir.,NA"So, where should I ask the question from?
","
From the first class.",NAAnywhere.,I.,NAWhat is your project?,Our project is classification of a student's mathematical answer using BART machine learning,HighClassification?,Yes.,NA"How are you classifying them?
What models are you using?","We are using 10 models sir.
SVM, KNN, random forest, linear regression, XG boost, Ada boost, Kata boost and Gaussian MBA.",High"Okay.
Neb-based classifier u r using?","
Yes sir.",NACan you explain Neb-based classifier?,"Neb-based classifier is like a Bayer's theorem and it is like probability.
It is like probability and for now should I ask?",MediumWhatever you have understood tell it.,"It is based on the probability, accuracy, we can define it.
It is in the probability.",Medium"
Okay.
Right.
Is there any assumption for using Neb-based classifier?",Sir.,NAIs there any condition to be made so that we can use Neb-based classifier?,"No sir.
I mean we have used many models and in that we feel, I mean to get the more accuracy, we have used this Neb-based classifier.",High"
Very good.
Right.
Neb-based classifier is a classifier, right?",Yes.,NAIs classification supervised learning or unsupervised learning?,"Supervised learning.
It is supervised learning.",HighWhy is it a supervised learning?,"Because in classification, classification supervised learning, because in classification, if we take a value so or because of anything, we cannot take, we have to do in that order and we cannot lie in anywhere else.
For example, passing or failing a subject or emails, if it is spam or not.",LowSo that is why it is supervised?,Yes sir.,NA"You explain what is classification, not why it is supervised?","Supervised learning means if you take a label data and that data, we have to take to teach a model and for teaching the training model, we have to take a simple data set and for the data set, for explicit programming, we will use that.",Low"
Very good.
Don't get tense.
You are becoming too tense.",Yes.,NA"Okay.
You are telling things correctly, so why are you getting tense?
You know things.
Okay.","
Yes sir.",NA"Yes.
So now, let us say you have built a model.
How will you find out whether this model is a good model or not a good model?","Okay sir.
Based on the accuracy will say.",MediumBased on the accuracy we will find out.,"Suppose if we take like random forest, I mean, if we take some normal models, we get normal accuracy, but we have used for another process stacking classifiers.
Based on this comparison, we got for models like 66% or 67% accuracy.
And in stacking classifier, based on that, we got 97 and 96% accuracy.",Medium"Okay.
So basically accuracy you use to find out whether model is good or bad.
Right.
Can you tell me what is the problem or with what is the problem with using accuracy as a measure?","Probe.
Accuracy as a measure.",High"What kind of issues it can create for us if we use accuracy as a measure?
","
We can use like formula.",Medium"
So accuracy has a formula, so it has a problem.","No, no sir.",High"
Then what is problem with accuracy?
Where can accuracy be very misleading?","When it has like formula, when it has data.",Medium"
Relax.
Don't worry.
Don't get tense.","Yes,",NA"
Ami i asking very difficult questions?",Easy questions,NA"Easy question.
So then think and answer.",When the data is not correct or we have to test the data.,High"We have to test the data.
Right.
So what is the problem of testing the data with accuracy as a measure?
The problem is with accuracy not with testing or model.
So what is the problem with accuracy?
Or rather let me be very specific in asking.",Yes sir.,NAWhen do you think accuracy can give you wrong information or wrong impression?,"When the data is not correct.
When we are doing the data correctly .i mean
When we are testing the data, then accuracy may not be correct.",MediumOkay.,And again we have to test the data whether we have to check whether the data is correct.,Medium"Okay.
You said you have used KNN.","Yes sir.
",NAIs KNN a linear classifier or non-linear classifier?,KNN is linear or non-linear classifier.,HighBoth.,"
Yes sir",NASo that is like telling you are both boy and girl.,"No, it is a linear classifier.",HighKNN is a linear classifier.,Yes.,NAWhy do you say KNN is a linear classifier?,"KNN is like near most nearest neighbors.
And if we take two points like category A and B.
And if we take a new point and if the category A has nearest neighbor.
Then we will take the new data point and category A.",Medium"
That is why it is linear.",Yes sir.,NA"Okay.
If you say I will accept.
","If it is wrong, I will just get to know.",High"I won't give you the answer in viva am i, right?","Okay sir.
I will answer.",High"Yes.
You know, you know that the data can be low dimensional or high dimensional.",Yes,NA"Right?
So if you have a low dimensional data or you have a high dimensional data.
Which one would you choose?",Low dimensional data.,NA"
Why?","Because based on the futures, we will get to know the dimensionality reduction.
And if you take a low dimensional data, then we will get more.",Medium"You will get more work.
More marks.","
no sir ",NA"More.
Then.",More accuracy.,NA"You will get more accuracy if you have low dimensional data.
So which means your dimensionality increases, accuracy goes down.","
Oh. Wait sir..
It's more dimensionality like less accuracy, no sir.",MediumThen.,Like dimensionality more only we have to take.,Medium"
More you have to take.
So more is good.","Yes sir.
More dimensionality and more accuracy.",High"Okay.
Many more accuracy.
Then many more dimensionality.
So as the dimensionality grows, the accuracy goes on increasing.",Hmm.,NASo it will exceed 100% at some point of time.,"Yes sir.
But it will come for some data.",High"Okay.
So low dimensionality is bad.",Yes.,NAThen why do we do dimensionality reduction?,"Uh.
If the date of.
We do dimensional detection because of the input values which we are taking sir.",Low"Yeah, but when reducing dimensionality is bad, so do we do dimensionality reduction?","No sir.
we should not do.",Medium"
So we are doing all the wrong things.","
We are doing correct things sir.
But some cases we may not be taking.",Medium"Okay.
Good.
How did the course go for you?","
Well sir.",NAWhat was good about the course?,"I learned so many things sir.
I mean even if I take some courses outside, I didn't learn like online classes and I am not able to take anything.
But it's offline means I learned so many things.
Like from first onwards, except in middle like the bayers theorem that classes are you and except that everything is good sir.",LowYou have understood it.,Yes sir.,NA"Anything I can improve?
What is the feedback for me?","Nothing sir.
Really nothing.

Otherwise if any faculty comes we will not be able to learn anything.
Like we just only learnt from it sir and by hearting everything.
But because of the viva of us yesterday everything not only yesterday but previous was like for quiz, mid-sem  it's we learnt so many videos like we have heard examples.
Everything is good sir.",Medium"No no.
All teachers are good.
Somewhere you are paying attention.
Other place you are not paying attention.
","
I mean you are strict teacher.
That's why we have been more attention sir.",MediumAhh.. that you can say.,Yes sir.,NAOkay thank you.,Thank you sir.,NAYour roll number is one.,120,NA What have you prepared for viva?,"
I prepared the basics classification.
KNN.",Mediumbasics KNN you have prepared.,"
Yes sir.",NAis KNN is supervised learning algorithm or unsupervised.,Sir it is unsupervised.,HighWhy do you say it is unsupervised?,"Sir like it can be used both actually.
So it is unsupervised like clustering right example.
Like it KNN clustering we are trying to find the patterns in the data.
But in supervised learning we can use KNN air is tables to predict a class label.
",Medium"Okay.
So there is a KNN clustering is it?",K means clustering.,NASo K means KNN are is same is it?,"
No sir no sir.
It is not the same.
Then there is K means clustering and there is KNN  is neighbors.
It is a two different.",Medium"Okay.
So KNN is supervised or unsupervised?",It is supervised.,NAWhy?,Sir like in the app like if we take example application we are trying we are using it to predict a class label.,Okay.,So we know what we are predicting it is supervised learning right.,Medium"Okay.
So is KNN a linear classifier or non-linear?
",It is a linear.,MediumWhy do you say it is linear?,Actually sir I am not sure.,High"you are not sure.
Okay.
So what is the effect of normalization on KNN?","So we are trying to normalize the values on a scale.
See without normalization there would be many outliers in the data like noisy data.
So it makes it easier when using KNN.
Like we will get more accurate predictions.",MediumWhy?,"Because without normalization taking in consideration the outliers the noisy data.
So if after doing normalization then it won't take into consideration.
It's like putting all the data into a scale.
So it makes it easier to apply.
",MediumIt makes it easier for whom for the machine?,To apply the techniques like this.,High"You explain how it is easier.
You can use pen and paper maybe example if you want.
","So if we have a certain data and these are some data and here there is some outliers.
If we don't normalize it it's taking in consideration this outliers.
When it applies KNN or any technique the outcome like the prediction is not so accurate.
But when we normalize it into one small scale then we can get better outcome.
",Medium"
And that one you told earlier also.
The question is why?","I'm not sure.
I don't know how to explain it.",High"
No problem.
What is the effect of dimensionality on KNN?",Sir it improves the performance.,HighHow?,"Like when reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.
We are trying to remove the irrelevant features.
",HighOkay,Sir we are trying to reduce variance.,HighWe are trying to reduce what?,The variance.,NA"Variance.
Okay.
But dimensionality reduction.",It helps in reducing variance.,High"Okay.
How did the course go for you?","Sir okay.
Yes.",HighAny feedback for me?,"Sir.
Actually near the end of the course.
And near the end of the semester I started studying more.
So if I had started earlier it would have been better for me.",HighWhy did you not study earlier?,"Sir it's my fault on this.
Like I don't get interest in things so fast.
It takes me a lot of time to get interest.
I didn't do well in mid-Sems because of that.
",Medium"
Okay.
Anything else?","
No sir.
Thank you very much.",NAThank you.,"Sir not only like your subject normally for any subject I have problems finding interest.
",MediumI understand.,," Did you have breakfast?
Why not?",I woke up late sir.,HighWhat have you prepared?,"Classification, regression and rest are I saw.",Medium"Classification and regression you have prepared and rest all you have seen very well.okay
Classification and regression are the supervised algorithms or unsupervised.
","Both classification and regression are supervised algorithms.
They have label data sets.
",High"Just because they have labelled, that is supervised.","They do the prediction based on the label data sets.so
When they take the feature values, they have a clear objective of what to predict.",High"Objective is there but where is supervised here?
Why is it called supervised?","Based on the predictions while training, they can...
Since they know what the objective is, they can fine tune the hyper parameters.
And make the model better?",HighWhat are parameters and what are hyper parameters?,"Hyper parameters are basically... are usually given manually.
",High"
Hyper parameters are given manually.","If we see KNN case hyper parameters, K is a hyper parameter we can decide how many neighbors we can consider.",High"Right.
And parameters?","Parameters while training, we can decide the parameters.",High"For training, you can decide the parameters.
Like which to use, which not to use is it.
Okay.
When does training happen in KNN?","Yes.
After deciding the number of neighbors that are to be considered, we will find the distances from each data point.
And the nearest neighbors are...
The data point is assigned to that class.
",High"
Okay.
Right.
What is the parameter here?",K. ,NAK is parameter.,"
Like distance to the nearest distance.",HighDistance is the hyper parameter.,"K is the hyper parameter.
The number of neighbors that are to be considered distance is the parameter.
",HighDistance is the parameter.,"
So, assign and two particular class.",Medium"Right.
Okay.
Parameters hyper parameters is that.
What is the effect of... Effect of normalization on KNN?",Of normalization on KNN.,HighYes.,"So, when we do normalization, it basically scales the data.
Like, it will... Standardize the range in which the point should lie.
",HighYes,"So, if we are taking more K value, like in the Modeling testing for a particular point, if more the K value, it will consider more number of neighbors or it will lie within the same class.",High"Yeah, but what is normalization what to do here?
You take the K number of neighbors and do the class decision based on K neighbors.
Whether you normalize or you don't normalize.
So, how does normalization help you?
",It will try to reduce over 50.,High"Normalization?
How.
First what is overfitting and second thing is how?","Overfitting is like when the model is too well trained.
It will perform well on the training data.
But when we are trying to test it, because of the overly trained training data, it won't perform well on this testing.
",Medium"That is overfitting.
Right.
So, how does normalization help avoid that problem?
Okay.
How does dimensionality affect KNN?
","Dimensionality, if we are considering more number of dimensions, like suppose we are considering BMI.
We don't need more number of dimensions.
We only need height and weight.
But if we are taking more dimensions, the model is spending more time on training the data based on all the dimensions.
",High"
In KNN, right?","
Dimensionality, in KNN. ",High"If you don't like K, you will tell me L change the model.
The question still remains the same.
Come on.
Okay.
How does KNN work?","Like, there are different data points.
And we will decide the K number of neighbors, which are to be considered.
And we will find the distance from that one data point to the other data.
Like, if we are taking a test point, we are considering the distance from that particular point to all the other neighbors.
And the K number of neighbors, which are closer to this test point, this test point will be assigned to that particular class.",High"Right.
How do we use K and N for regression problem?
You have used K and N regression in your project, right?
",Yes.,NA"So, how does KNN work as a regression?","
I think it's a good idea to have KNN. ",High"Okay.
How do you measure the models efficiency for a regression?",Performance metric.,NAYes,"M mean absolute error.
M mean square error, root mean square error, R square.
R squared.
M mean absolute percent error.
This is the performance metric.
",High"Can you write formula for mean absolute percentage error?
And this is the performance metric.
This is the performance metric.","i Forgot
I will try to deal with it again.",Medium"Okay.
How did the course go for you?","It was nice.
It was nice, too.
It was advancing.
It was nice.
It was fascinating.
I fell too interesting.",LowAny feedback for me.,"
Very nice.
One class with a attended like very interestingly.",Low"
Thank you very much.","
Thank you.",High" Yes, Maneesh please tell me what should I ask you?","Classification, regression and clustering.
",HighWhat is the difference between classification and regression?,"Classification is also supervised learning , which is to predict continuous values, while the regression is to predict the discrete values.",High"Okay.
Can you give some example problem scenarios where classification should be used.
",Classification is for character recognition systems and for regression we will be using stop prediction.,Medium"Right.
So how do you measure the models efficiency for regression and classification?",So for classification we will be using accuracy precision recall all those metrices and for regression we will be using mean absolute errors.,HighWhat is your project?,Segmentation free character recognition systems.,HighWhich metric are you using?,"We will be using for classification precision because based on the two we will be having the set of labels and we will be having the predictor characters based on the true positive amount of our two positives and the characters.
",Medium"So, suppose I have a three class classifications problem.
Right.
How will you calculate the precision?","So, three class classifications.
So, it is like we as on the prediction will be comparing with the actual labels and getting the values.
",Medium"Okay.
All right.
So, let us take an example.
Let us say you are taking five fruits per classification.
You can note down.
So, then the five fruits are orange.
Orange.
You can put O over orange.
Orange tomato, orange, brinjal, and orange.
Okay.
And they are classified as orange.
Orange.
Orange.
Tomato.
And tomato.","
sir wait i only wrote 4 sir
Tomato.
Orange.
Orange.",High"
Then last two classifications tomato and tomato.
Can you calculate what is the precision of this?","
Okay.
Zero point four.",HighWhy you said zero point four and how did you come to that number?,"So, it is like four most two positive points, two positive plus four positive.
",Medium"So, correct.","And as like two positive is like I didn't think orange.
Mapping and each mapping is a two positive.
I am just saying values.
Two things were like identifiers two positive.
And as like again, false positives are remaining things.
So, two plus three.
",Low"All others are false positive.
Okay.
All right.
So, what is the influence?
You don't do anything.
You don't do anything.
What is the influence of data normalization on the classification performance?","Normalization.
So, it is like if you have a wide range of data, it will be having discrete values like the values might be sparse.
So, it is like if you are going to analyze two, like when you analyze it to set off values, like for identifying the, I mean, there is presence of many out layers or if there is any presence of any like for identification of errors, it will be a bit helpful, it is more helpful.",Low"Okay.
It is like, and how do you fill missing values?
","Using fill null functions.
There is any presence of null values, we will be using that.
We will be checking with this null and we will be filling it with the fill null function.
",MediumWhat does the fill null function do?,"So, fill the null values with zeros or like the specified values, which we will be using.",High"So, how do you know which values should specify?
Sir, it is like we will be taking each column, as well like with the cursor to come, I mean, we will be iterating through each values.
If there is any presence of null values, and we will be using this all fill null function, and we will be able to respect values which we use.
Zeroes.","You always fill it up with zeros, 
zeros or most commonly with, ",Medium"
what is the most commonly number?
100.","So, like based on the mean values, we will be taking the mean of median, all those things.
Probably we will be using that means, we will be calculating mean of the column, if it is a, numerical values, we will be calculating the mean of the column, then we will be filling the values with the mean values.
Because mean is like most average values of all those columns.
",Medium"
What is the difference between mean and median?","So, mean is the average of all values given data set, while median represents the middle value.
",HighWhat do mean by middle value?,"Mean, in the certain designs, like if we have 100, I mean 100 data, the middle most value in the,",Low"suppose I have data values ranging from 1 to 50.
So, my middle value is 25.","25th values we got.
In the index 25th, the order, in the sense we will be arranging it in ascending order first, then we will be taking the middle values.
",Medium"All right.
Okay, how did the course go for you?",It went good.,High"
What part of course went good?","I was able to have a lot of the course, so I am good.
Like I am, like what are the concepts?
We will understand the concept machine learning.",LowAny feedback from me?,That was quite good,HighAnywhere I can improve.,"So, I was like, you are perfect.",HighThank  you  very  much.,"
Thank you so much.",NA What is your project?,"Sir our project is actually on the quiz based marks where we will be giving the marks for each and every question as if there is a paper of 50 marks every student may get 50 marks but they write in different ways, somewhere write in three lines, somewhere write in four lines.
So by that we are using regression and getting the values.
We are using some 10 folds and then we are using linear regression all those things finding the map values, MA values all those things and finding the results.",LowSo please help me understand why you chose to use regression.,Sir because as we classify from because in regression we can predict the values which we can find and then in regression and then in regression comparable to classification regression we get good outputs and whereas we such as we will be having more and more regression like linear regression and then decision tree so we can find more things and then we can find the accuracy all those things and then confusion matrix.,Low"So you use regression.
So can you tell me how you use confusion matrix for regression?",Sir sorry sir it is in classification.,HighOkay so you can use confusion matrix for regression.,Sir I am not sure.,High"
So what can you use for regression measurement?","Sir map RMSM all those things are like we have formed us like 1 by N into yi minus y my mean upon my mean so that we can find the map values RMS values all those things and we can get the accuracy all those things.
",LowOkay RMSC and MAP,yes sir.,NA"
What does MAP stand for?
What is the full form of MAP?",sorry sir.,NAOkay what is the range of values you get for MMP?,"
Sir actually I can answer any questions or classifications all these things.",Medium"
But your problem project is a regression problem right.","
Sir sir we did but I am not into this",Medium"
Okay.
So what are the different measuring measurements we have for classification model?","Sir like in classification can I describe for start classification like we have two classifications like parametric classification linear classifications and KNN classification and in which what parametric classification exactly is that it has parameters and it cannot change value when we train it it cannot grow on much and then coming to linear regression it goes as usual and then KNN and classification comes we take the distance between them and then we find the definite value and then what you are sir performance, performance matrices like cosine similarity is there and jacket similarity all those things we can find.
And then coming to in that we have something called when the data set is large or some input is large we get outliers so from that we can find few find three or four or that is min max normalization Z all the min maximum like formalize there sir A I minus A minimum upon A minus A max into B I where B I and new values of B are the which the range are be given 0 to 5 all those things.",High,"And then in even in parametric we can use logistic regression sir because as logistic regression predicts a value from 0 to 1 and it has something called sigmoid function which can be also set at activation which is 1 by 1 minus 1 plus E power minus Z and that is the way we can use as classification itself says that it it all it separates the group which are already predicted labels and as we say sir we divide them into two groups like a supervised learning and unsupervised learning whereas supervised have consist of regression and classification errors unsupervised consist because in supervised you have to give the labels there is no need to give labels in clustering which is unsupervised and in supervised you find the outputs outputs and targets but there you can find the patterns and all those things in unsupervised.
As in supervisor we are talking about regression classification so there will be a KN main and the difference between there will be small difference because in even classification there are KN but in even clustering there is KN and the difference is that here we directly find the distance and we find which is the nearest point but in KN and clustering what happens we find the centroid and then we update for every value which is coming ",Highvery good you have prepared very well.,So the other thing is that sorry sir because I didn't look much on our part I did the product but I didn't look much on parts sir.,MediumOkay you said you are using linear regression for classification,"no sir no sir in just a we get yeah I said that in classification there is parametric classification in that we can apply logistic regression which is like sigmotic function which predicts the zero on value which we can using classification
",Medium so how can you use logistic regression for classification ,"
sir.
Sir like predicting the sigmoid function value activation function what I prefer that f of z equal to 1 by 1 plus e power minus z.",MediumWhat is the difference between regression and classification ,"sir
Sir the difference is as regression which predicts the values which will come forward like sir if you are buying a house which predicts the area or location all those things whereas in classification it is actually regression is like continuous values sir like it will go on it will depend on the other variables like it is the as linear regression itself so yes it is a relationship between a dependent and one or more independent values like if we have a column we have three columns where it will be independent but the end target value will be dependent on it whereas our classification is a discrete value which is like direct yes or no or you have to classify like it is a dog or cat all those things.",MediumSo you said that classification example is that you find out whether it is dog or cat.,I think I mean we find discrete values sir we divide them into groups and we classify them,High"so does logistic regression is another discrete values.
",Sir logistic regression is something like which predicts the value between 0 and 1,High"so how will you get for classification it is not discrete values right
", sir but when we use of when we use parametric classification or linear classification in both logistic regression can be used to find the to find the sigmoid function of the graph that we used, can you name one parametric classifier ,"
sir parametric ",NAclassifier ,parametric classifier.,NA"
Okay.
What is binning?", binning.,NA"All right.
So for classification on how do you measure the model?
How do you measure the model?","Classifications sir as I said we take many parameters like we find the confusion matrix all those things 
",Medium"confusion matrix.
Okay.",Like even I said sir when outliers are coming in that we can find we can neglect them by using 3 min max foundation all the three values for the sink,MediumAnd what do you do for regression sir?,Sir for regression as I said the parametric will be definitely this map all RMS things for linear regression like the equation itself is that Y equal to theta naught plus theta 1x where theta 1 we can consider slope and we can do a formula like least square estimation where it is the formula is exactly 1 by n into again direct like variance of xy upon variance of x square if we get in direct terms and then we find ms and then we RMS is like root of ms and ms e formula straight 1 by n into y minus yy minus yy bar where yy is normal of value and target value and y it is a mean so we can find those values.,Medium"
Okay.
Good.
How did the course go for you?","
Sir it was fine sir.",High"
What is your feedback for me?",Sir it was too good sir but the only problem is we were sitting in very back so sometimes the sound problem was there other than that there was no things.,Medium"
Thank you very much.","
Thank you sir",NADid you have breakfast?,"Yes, sir.",NA"Okay.
What is your project on?","Uh, bird call  or no  bird call classification.",High"
Is that a classification problem or a what kind of problem?","
It is a classification problem.",HighWhy do you say it is a classification problem?,"Uh, so that's because like you're using two different classes like, you're dividing your data as a no bird and bird.
So it's not going to have any numerical  values and your data is categorically here.
So that is where you have a classification.",High"Suppose I said that you can attend the same thing with clustering.
Would you agree with me or disagree?","Uh, you can try it with clustering because the fact that no bird and bird is like having two different, like completely different audio's rate.
So clustering can actually give a better results also because the features are different.",Medium"Yeah, but will I be able to attend my objective using clustering?","
You can.",High"I can.
Then why are you using classfication?",Because that will be better.,HighHow?,"Uh, clustering can actually lead to misclassifications rate.
If there is any noise that is on unrecognized.
At cases clustering can give different values.
Classification also can give that but then classification is better because you are not like doing unsupervised learning here.",Medium"
You are doing what?",Yeah?,NA"What are you doing?
You are not doing unsupervised learning.
Then what are you doing?","
Supervised learning.",NA"
Supervised learning.
Why are you the supervised?","
Because we are giving it a target like to classify it as this or that.",High"
And what is this target used for?","Well, it used for.",High"
Yeah.
So you are giving it a target.
For example, I give you lot of lectures and you don't care for it.
So what is the use of me giving lectures?
Similarly, you might be giving targets but if the model doesn't use it, then it is useless.
So what does the model use these targets for?","It uses these like every file has different features.
So these features you are giving a target as word and no word.
So it is going to use that label to check for these similar features.
Like to check for the numerical values.
It gives.
So in that way, what happens is for any test case you take, it can try to compare with the different features it has and based on that, it can classify it.",Medium"
Very good.
What are the different classifiers you have used?","One we have used is KNN we have used.
Then we have used SVM also.
Then we have tried with the XG boost.
Then Cad Boost also we have tried and random forest.",Medium"
Okay.
Let's go with two simple classifiers.
One is KNN and other is support vector.
What is the underlying principle difference between these two?","
In KNN, it is basically KNN-yours neighbors.
So for all the observations you take, it is going to compare like, check with the voting mechanism here.
So any test case you take, it is going to check for the nearest neighbors it has and it is going to use a voting system where it can check for which has the majority in that room.
But in SVM, it is going to use a hyperplane where it can be divided into two classes.
So that is the difference it has.",Medium"That is the working principle difference.
I am asking what is the underlying difference?
Conceptual difference between these two?","Conceptual difference.
Okay.
SVM one thing is it is a bi-classification model.
And KNN can be used for classifying different ones.
And it is multi-classification model.
And underlying principle?",Medium"From vector space notation, how do that two things differ?","Oh, the we use.
I don't know.",Medium"Your input vectors are points in the vector space, right?
So how do these two classifiers deal with the same set of points differently in the vector space?",Okay.,NADo they deal with it same way or different ways?,Different.,NA"Differently.
Okay.
So can you bring out the difference?","So if I say for SVM, for SVM, you would take any particular test point.
It will lie in either one side of the plane.
So if you have taken a hyperplane, any one side of the hyperplane it has to do.
So based on that, you are going to classify.
But in KNN, you take the surrounding of the test point.
And then you check for the distances between the test point and the observations here.
But for SVM, you don't do that.
You are checking with respect to the hyperplane only.",Medium"
So now given that you have described to this extent, okay, generalize how the two models are behaving differently.
Do you have any different changes?","Yeah.
So what is the principle behind, see, for example, why do you say these two models are different?
They are doing the same thing.
That's the equation.",Medium"So what is, you are saying, are they doing the same thing or are they doing different things?
The objective is same.",Yeah.,NA"Okay.
Objective is same.
But are they doing it same way or different way?",They are different.,High"
So what is the difference?","
The voting mechanism which can, this one doesn't do this.",HighAre you sure?,Yeah,NA"Okay.
All right.
Suppose you have categorical data values.
What is it available to you?
How will you use it for SVM?","How will I use it for SVM?
I can do categorical values.
If in case it is categorical, maybe I can try doing one-how to improve it.
And then I can try to classify these based on that target one.",MediumCan you tell me one advantage and one disadvantage of one advantage?,"One advantage can be, like, one-how to encoding, like, because it is converting the categorical to numerically, you can apply different things on that.
When I say disadvantage, at times, there can be places where, if you are using a model, the value is new.
You can give numerical values to them, right?
So in that places, there can be a chance that for a particular categorical value, you will have a different numerative value.
So every time you change the model, it will behave differently.",Medium"
Okay.
And that happens in one or another input?","That does not happen in one.
Okay.
One-how to encoding?
This I got this.
Not in any way.",Low"
So it doesn't have any disadvantages.","One can be that if you have too many categorical values, then when you form a vector, it will be too large enough.
So the dimensionality will increase.",Medium"Okay.
Yeah, that will be the disadvantage.
Right.
So how did you find the course?","Interesting.
First.",MediumWhat was interesting about that?,"So I believe it's very different.
I'm learning something new first.
I'm very curious person.
So I'm learning very new things.
Then I listen to things very attentively.
So that is there.
And this is interesting because I love time.",LowOkay.,"So that is one more thing.
Yeah.",High"
Good.
What is your feedback for me?","
So we would prefer having you next time.
That's how much I like your teaching.",Medium"
How can I improve?","I can improve.
I know thinking that is better to improve because you teach really well.",Medium"
Thank you very much.","
Thank you.",NA Prepared?,"
Yes sir.",NAWhat did you prepare?,"
Sir, from the basic concepts, all the types of learnings and then the metrics, classification, and then how to, somewhat about perceptron models and then decision-tries and then the different types of learnings.",Medium"Okay, very good.
Let's start with boosting and bagging.
What's the difference?","Sir, boosting and bagging, both the process and decision-tries, they use the decision-tries.
Boosting, it performs in a sequential manner, whereas banking performs in a parallel way.
And simultaneously the process gets executed, boosting a sequential manner.",MediumThis is during training or testing?,"During, trainings.",MediumWhat happens during testing?,"Sir testing, both will be similar, I mean, both will be on the same level.",MediumWhat do you mean?,"I mean, the work takes some similar time for city and other.
I mean, I say that's not much different during testing, because already the model is trained.
So, testing will be as same for both, similar, not exactly same, but very much similar.",Low"Okay.
Can you give me one example of boosting classifier?","Sir, boosting classifier, XG boost.",High"XG boost.
How does XGboost work?","Sir, XG boost, it mainly focuses on improving the speed, implementing the speed and performance of the models.",High"How?
Don't get tense.
Okay.
You are like, you know, about to explode.
Calm down.
Am I asking very difficult questions?","No, sir.",NAAnd then why are you getting so tense?,"I am unable to frame them, but I have to frame them.
",High"You may be in diagram, you can explain or whatever.
Okay.Sure.
Can you name one bagging classifier?
Okay.
How do you measure the performance of a classifier?","
How do you measure the performance?
Sir, as we have the performance, matrix based on the concentration matrix.",MediumConclusion matrix.,"
Yes, sir.
From that we have matrix accuracy, precision, recall, reference score, based on them, V measure.",HighWhat is your project?,"Sir, my project is on, as you think of confidence on spoken answers.",Medium"Confidence.
Is that a classification problem or a regression problem?","
Sir, we can actually do it in both ways.
I mean, we can do it as a classification, classification and regression problem.
But we went on to do a classification.",High"
Okay.
So, how do you make a classification problem?","
Yes, sir.
So, first, primarily, we have the data set of audio files.
Or files of the both speakers, the interaction during the Viva.
So, we have transcribed the audio, then we got text.
We have classified them as a speaker one and speaker two.
As we only need the confidence of speaker two, the student with giving answers.
So, we have kept the speaker one, the middle quotient and changes of speaker one into the reject class.
So, now we'll focus on the speaker two.
So, we have labeled them manually, confidence minus one, zero and one for low moderate and high confidence respectively.
And then we processed it.
If we have null values, if there are some words which are irrelevant, we have, we have what do you say, clean the data mainly.
And then we have proceed to different types of embeddings like TF, IDF, BERT, GLOW, like that we have used some embeddings.
And then we have trained the model using 70 30 ratio of parent test percentage.",HighDo you have equal number of classes for all the different classes in your training set?,"No, sir.
Firstly, we did not get, we found a huge imbalance and we also got overfitting the models.
So, we have used a smat, smat, then it gradually balanced the classes in that.",High"
So, when you have a class imbalance problem, do you use accuracy?","No, sir.",NAWhy not?,"Sir, accuracy is a metric, we use in the class patient, right?
Because now here the classes are already imbalance.
So, using the accuracy in the imbalance classes gives, gives no value.
I mean, it means nothing.",MediumIt means nothing.,"
It means the value, even if it gives some of the value, the values of no user.",LowWhy do you say that?,"
So, because the class are imbalanced, right?",High"If you put on a class imbalance,
 how does class imbalance affect accuracy?","Yes, sir.
Suppose there are two classes, yes and no, sir.
true or false  maybe.
Sir, suppose there are, let's say male and female as both classes.
Suppose there are 95, 95 females.
This is the clear indication that both classes are unbalanced.
I mean, they have imbalanced.
So, when you apply the accuracy metric on this, it automatically gives accurate to male.
Because this is a majority class.
The accuracy is directly, it is tend to the majority class.
So, even if it gives, so the class is already imbalanced.
Whatever the value it gives, it would not be considered in the following steps, right?",Medium"Okay.
Good.
How did you find the course?","It's quite good.
Up to mid and after mid, okay.
The last terms, like I said, the bagging and boosting, that's where I lag.",High"
What is your feedback for me?","Good, sir.
I lag 4.5 to 5.
Because the last two concepts are very high.
I lag.",Medium"I am asking, what can I improve?","Nothing.
Not a big fairing for you, but to ask what I really like the way you spend.
I mean, it's not like taking the tension mode, as you are the senior faculty also.
Some behave that they have tried in there, but very much students, they get fear to meet them.
But we have nothing.
You are so indulging me to spend much and all.",MediumThank you.,Thank you so much.,NAyour number is 133.,"Yes, sir.",NA Did you have breakfast?,"Yeah, I had.",NASo what have you prepared well for Viva?,"Classification, regression.",NA"
Classification and regression.
Any specific models?","I know a little bit about PCA,SVM",High"
Yes, we have a PCA.",I know a little bit about concept.,Medium"
What do you know I will ask there?
I will ask there.
What do you know why I will ask there?","I have classification.
Performance, my choice.",Medium"Performance, my choice.
Classification.
Is classification a supervised learning problem or a unsupervised learning problem?",It is a classification supervised.,Medium"Classification supervised.
Can you give an example use case problem scenario where classification can be used?","See, basically classification is you are taking one of the one of the of feature and classifying it to which group it belongs to.
Classification is basically splitting it to groups.
If it is a boy, it is a boy and girl will be in the girl.
So we are creating a classifying which group it falls into.",High"Why it is a supervised learning?
So you talked about performance matrix.
What performance matrix can be used for a classification problem?","Performance matrix.
So in that we can find accuracy precision recall F1 score.",Medium"Precise precision recall F1 score.
Specificity.
Which one to be used?
Why do we have so many performance matrix?","See, first accuracy we are using accuracy to see how well it is accurate.
Now, think we have 100 samples and in that 50 are correct.
So we say that 50% is accurate.
And precision is used to find how more precise it is.
It is more depth.
Like accuracy just says how much accurate it is.
And precision just tells us how close we are to the actual value.
So in accuracy we use that true positive plus true negative.
So there we are checking if it is truly positive or truly negative.
So and precision we see the true positive by true positive and true negative.
False positive.
So we are seeing how actually it is true to the actual value.",High"Okay, and what will you do if it is a multi-class scenario?","
Multi?",NAMultiple classes are there.,We find that we find for every class and we compare it.,Hgih"
What do you find for every class and compare?",The performance matrix like accuracy precision,MediumSo you will calculate accuracy for each class?,Yeah.,NA"Okay.
And precision and recall for each class.
So let us say you have oranges, tomatoes and brinjal.
Okay.
What is the formula you said for recall?","
Recall is…",NA"If you want to write in term,you can write in term","So accuracy is true positive plus true negative by true positive plus positive plus negative plus positive plus true negative.
And precision is true positive by true positive plus false positive.
Recall is true positive by true positive plus false negative.
I think I confused a little.",Medium"
You are confused a little for creating a confusion matrix.
So how would in the example case I gave you, brinjals, tomatoes and oranges?
How would the confusion matrix look like?","See, now if you have oranges, brinjals and whatever, here we can ask how many true positive, how many oranges are actually there?",High"
Can you draw the confusion matrix for these three classes?","Okay.
Okay, see if totally there are 100 fruits and in that 50s oranges, actually 50.
But if you predict there are 30.
So true positive will actually be 50 because there are actually 50 and... Our false positive will be 30.
Our false positive will be 30.
No, no, no, wait.
Yeah, our false negative will be 30.",MediumWhat happened to the rest 20?,"No, no, no, no.
I am not sure how confused.",Medium"No, no, don't have confusion.
Think propery and answer.
You don't need to take so much of time.
No, no, don't have confusion.
Think properly and answer.
You don't need to take so much of stress.
It's not worth it.",I think 30 will be truly negative because they are predicting it wrong.,High"Okay.
And if it is predicted wrong, can it be true negative?
What does the word true and negative mean in true negative?",I am going to be false negative.,Medium"It will be false negative.
Right.
How do we reduce dimensionality of data?","We can increase the data dimensionality for data.
We can use encoder.",Medium"I think your friend is becoming restless there.
Okay.
So you can use one or one hot coding to reduce dimensionality.",From hot or label in your first two?,Medium"To reduce dimensionality.
Okay.
How did the course go for you?
How did you find this course?","
A little difficult.",NAWhat was difficult here?,"
I don't know.
Midsem was fine.
I was 34.
quizes  were harder.",HighSo you are measuring everything by marks?,"
I mean, Midsum was problem based more.
So it was more solving.
Is this one more application?
So applications are a little difficult to understand.",Medium"
Okay.
And you get back for me?
We open a knowledge.","Yeah.
You teach well.
You interact well.",Hgih"
What can I do to improve?",I don't know.,NA"Okay.
On the list.
Thank you very much.
Number 134, right?",Yes sir,NaWhat are you prepared?,Classification model.Classification and symbol learning.,HighClassification andEnsemble learning.What ensemble learning models you have learned?,Random powers.Classification and symbol learning.,HighI have not thought of a model name basics.,"Basic of random, random powers that I was.",Mediumtell me how random first works.,"So random powers uses bagging for the selection of the data set.It's like we are dividing the data set into small, small data sets.What we are there will be labeling for each observation between 0 to 1.And then we will be giving a random value.And based on the random value the observation selected should be the labor of that observation should be less than n, but not greater than n. Less than equal to n, but not greater than n. And is the random value that we are selecting for selecting the observation for the random forest models",MediumThis is for what?,Yes sir.,NAThis is for what?,Classification.,NA"No, no, no.Why do you select this random number and how does it help you?",For selecting observations for each data set so that the data sets do not have the same observations.They might have some observation similar if the random values are similar.And then these observations we run the models on these data sets and the outputs which we get from these data sets we calculate the majority which is given as the main output.,HighOkay.Suppose you have data in different ranges.,Yes sir.,NA"And you don't do any normalization, so don't do it.How will it affect random forest properties?","Sir, for what do you mean by your specific range?Like a big range of numbers?",HighSome data are in small range.,Yes sir.,NAAnd because in big range there is variability of range from attribute to attribute.,Yes.,NA"So, typically we use normalization in such situation.",Yes sir.,NA"My question is if you don't normalize, will it affect random forest behavior?",Yes sir.,NAAnd so why?,"It will affect because it will be affected by the outliers and all if the data set is not in a particular range.The outputs which we get will be differing so much from each other.So, we can't give a general output.",HighCan you explain how outliers will affect their random forest?,"Sir, for dividing the data sets, the observations might differ from each other.Like the ranges might differ from each other.So, the output ranges, all the outputs which we get the ranges of that will differ from each other.We can't classify.We can't put it into classes.",HighWhy?You are just giving decisions without justifying why the disk is being given.It will not classify properly because Raya says so.,No sir.,NAThen what is the reason?,"Sir, because it will not classify properly.Sir, the model may be overfitting because of large number of large range.",MediumOkay.,"So, the dimensionality will be there.No sir, no sir.Dimensionality is the first number of each.Sir, that is all I can tell about this question.",MediumOkay.What about dimensionality?Does it affect random forest or not?,"Yes, sir.It will affect.The computations will be high if dimensionality increases.",HighIn random forest.How?,"No sir.For classification, it will be high for random forest.We are using only for dividing the data sets.So.",HighRandom forest cannot be used for classification.,"Sir, it can be used.",HighIs it a classifier or not?,Yes sir.,NA"So, it classifier problem.Of course, will it occur for random forest or not?",Yes.,NAThen you are contradicting your statement now.,"Yes sir, it will affect.",HighHow?,"Sir, it will be sparse data.Because of dimensionality.",High"Just because dimensionality increases, it becomes sparse data.What is sparse data?",Large range of data.,HighLarge range of data is sparse data.Very good.,Sir.,NA"So, let us say you are using random forest as a classifier.",Yes sir.,NAHow will you measure the random forest which is trained?Is good or bad?,"Sir, if one score?",MediumOkay.Why if one score?Why not something else?Like at the score.,"Sir, f1 score because it depends both on precision and recall.So, it will detect how many true positives, actual positives are detected as true.And how many false positives are there?",HighOkay.Is random forest a linear classifier or non-linear classifier?,linear classifier,NAWhy do you set it?,"Sir, non-linear classifier.",LowWhy do you set it?It is a non-linear classifier because.,"Sir, because it.Sir, because it does not follow a linear equation or something for classifying.",MediumIt further than non-linear equation.,May be.,NA"Interesting answer.I like it.Okay, good.How did the class go for you?","Sir, nice.",NAAnything bad for me?,"Sir, you wanted you for our elective courses also.But you told us not to play.",HighThank you very much.,Thank you.,NAWhat is your role remember?,154,NA154.Yeah.Right.What have you studied?,"Sir, before I mentioned classifier regressor, I am like sure I can tell something after that I am a little bit less confident.",High"Okay.Classifier regressor, what are the difference between regressor and classifier regressor?","Sir, in classification, there are some beautiful categories and you try to place the sample data into one of the categories.In case of regression, what we do, we have a set of features based on that we predict of numerical value.However, in case of logistic regression, we actually do classification between 0 or 1.Even if it is called regression, we are actually classifying the sample data there.",High"So, classification is classification, regression is also classification.","No, regression, we try to predict numerical value even in logistic reasoning, we predict either it is 0 or 1.Like value in between 0 and 1.",MediumCan you write the formula for logistic regression?,"Yes.In a one by one, it will be minus 6.",Medium"So, can you tell me how it will generate 0 or 1 values?",NO Sir,NAWhat kind of value will it generate?,Discrete values.,NAWill it?,"No, it should be e to the… No, no.It will definitely give values between 0 to 1.",MediumCorrect.Not discreeted.,I am not discreet.,High"So, then how does it make you take classifier?","Sir, I am not really sure because during this quiz exam, you gave like what does the logistic regression do?And the options were regression, ranking, classification, classification was the correct answer.",High"Okay.But you never asked, how does it do classifier?","It was like one sigmoid function in between 0 to 1.So, I thought, yeah, I never asked correct.",HighWhat is an activation function?,"Sir, activation function is a function like a sigmoid or RELU function that we used in backward propagation or… Sir, that is used for hyperparameter too.",MediumWhat is hyperparameter?,"So, hyperparameter is like the variables that used to train the model.The parameters are the columns, the features and the final value, what the model learns and how the model learns like the things which used to like optimize them model is hyperparameter.So, I am going to write it in the next class.",MediumCan you name some hyperparameters for perceptor?,Parameters. No sir,NASuppose there are two classes.Can you build a classifier with a perceptor for separating three classes?,Yeah.,NAYou can.,Yeah.,NASure.,Yeah.,NA"Okay.So, what does the activation function do in perceptor?",Idont know sir.,NAWhy is K&M called the lazy learner?,"So, it is called a lazy learner because you try to like… Suppose if you are making a K&M model for classifying real and fake images, K is the hyperparameter here.You will take various K like 0 to… From 0 to infinity, how many of your points you need?Based on that, you will see whether it is overfitting or underfitting or giving best fit conditions.Based on that, you will make the K&M.So, we do not really know which value to take at first.So, we have to try for every value and check when it is like a best fit.So, it is less than 0.",MediumWhat is the maximum value of K I can take in a K&M classifier?,The number of points of the… How many samples of the… ,Low"If I take K equal to the number of samples present, how do you know that?","Like samples minus 1 because you are taking 1 point and surrounding points, it will underfitting.Basically, we will just generate…",Medium"Generally, you know, to what?","Like suppose you are taking N in… K equals to N in K&M classifier.You are taking 1 point with some point that is very far from this point.And it is not a weighted K&M and then you are… Like the influence of that point on this… On the sample point is very minimal, but you are taking that points influence same as the point nearer to this point.",Medium"That happens for every value of K, isn't it?","Yeah, but that happens, but when you are taking very high value, it is like… Like the distance between the point at very far… It is very far… So, that point has no influence and so you won't be using the… If you are using a weighted K&M, that won't cause issue.",Medium"So, if I am using weighted K&M, K is equal to the number of samples available.There won't be any problem.",Computation issue only.,HighBut underfitting will be avoided.Because you said K equal to the number of samples available makes it underfitting right?,Yes sir.,NA"So, now if I change from K&M to weighted K&M, that problem won't be there.",Sure.Sure.,NAHow did the course go for you?,Fine.,NAYou need feedback from my improvement.,No sir,NAYou don't want to do that.Okay.Thank you,Thank you,NA" Okay.So, which module you have prepared well?That should I ask questions from?",Classification and regresiion.,HighClassification and regresiion., Yes sir.,NA"So, classification, regression are the supervised learning problems or unsupervised?","Yes, they are supervised learning.",HighAnd why do you say they are supervised learning?,"So, basically in supervised learning you have your target column as well.So, like based on your other features you predict how accurate your target feature is.So, that comes in the supervised learning.Like your model already know what the solution is going to be.It's just that it gives you the metrics on how correct your model is.",MediumOkay.And how is the unsupervised learning different?,"So, basically in unsupervised learning you don't have your final target.But then for example, let's say I take clustering.So, basically based on your surrounding features you like you predict your output.Like all similar features are like I do I prepare together.Like let's see like how cluster points are there.Like you take the distance like then let's see there's a point and then two centers.So, whichever it is nearer to it is it goes towards that.So, like it goes in that cluster.So, there's nothing like prediction by the new group similar types of points together.",MediumOkay.What is your project?,"So, basically in our project we are predicting how well your non-code block like your comments help like help modularize your code.Like how a user can understand when he's reading the code with comments without comments.So, it's based on a regression model.",Medium"So, for your regression models what are the performance metric you are using?","So, we are using MSE mean square error, root mean square error R square.We are using mean absolute percentage error.",HighRight.What is the difference between a regression problem and a classification problem?,"So, in classification problem you have class label as your final target.So, basically in that you are supposed to like predict if your row like the features of your row is either for example, let's say cat and dog.So, either tell if it's a cat or a dog based on it's other features.Whereas in regression basically like you grade something like let's say you have a code block.So, based on the code block like you give it marks and then you tell like you give it a number it's not like what you say it's not a categorical target value.I mean for the target column it's like based on numerical.",HighIn a regression problem suppose you are training on the output value in a given range.Like marks let's say you have trained it on 0 to 10.Can it's general to values outside 0 and 10?,"You cannot generate it outside your value because like you know if you like it's because it's already you know normalized.It can only be in a part of the range so it cannot be outside the range because because it's like each column let's say each column has like a specific feature like let's say one one of them is evaluating the top part one of them is evaluating them like has the metrics of the top part medium part.So, based on that it has a range that also it can only give the values in terms of range.So, like when you add up all the columns is going to come between 0 to 10.",MediumWhat are the different exploratory analysis you should conduct before you start training your model.,"So, like you know you have to check you have to check your if your data set is like does not have any missing values all your you know all your columns are like related to your related to whatever you are trying to predict.And so mainly you check for like missing values if your data set is like valid.",Medium"So, if you have missing values what will you do?","So, like you can impute them so you can replace those values by mean medium mode or you know like for categorical is mostly mode when you are medical mean medium you can replace them.",MediumWhat is the difference between mean and media?,"So, basically mean is like the let's say you have 8 values into values are missing.So, you sum all the 8 values you divided by 8 and then that is your mean and in median like you are place all of them in ascending order.So, like whichever is like in the middle that is your median like in a set of values.So, like basically mean is like the middle value like middle value in respect of the ascending or descending order.Media is like when it is ascending ordescending order you take the middle value like basically is the exact center of your range.Whereas mean is not always the exact center of your range it can be you know anything between the range based on the number of features you have or items you have.",MediumCan you have a mean value which is outside the range?,No sir,NAwhy not?,"So, because so like let's say you have 10 numbers and each of them let's say like that in the range 0 to 5.So, like even if you sum them your max value can be 50 and when you obviously you have to divide by 10 because you have 10 values.So, it is going to be either like I mean it is going to be only between the range or it can be the starting value or the ending value it cannot be outside your range.",MediumCan you prove that mathematical?,"I mean I can try but sir ok let's say like in the class let's take the height of all of them.So, like let's say the least height is 160 centimeters and the highest is like 185.So, like you add all the heights let's say even if everyone's height is 180 like the max height.So, even if you sum them and you I mean you find that average it's not going to cross 180 like the highest possible is 180 because it's not going out of it.",Medium"Good thinking is right.So, you do include some of the missing values using one of these central tendency.Then what do you do?","So, then you fill the missing after you do that you can you know like but you cannot tell that after you do that your data set is accurate because let's say you have a lot of missing value like 20% of your values are only 20% of your values are there and 80% are missing.So, you cannot consider mean medium to be you know like very accurate because it will be like it won't be based on your model but it will be like on the average of the model like that might completely change the outcome of your model.",Medium"Very good wonderful.So, if you have categorical values what will you do?",Sir I'll encode them using label encoding or one hot encoding.,HighWhat are the differences between these two encoding?,"So, basically in label encoding let's say you have like more than 5 categorical values or more than 2 categorical values.So, like you can give each of them a specific number like let's say days of the week you can give Sunday as one, Monday as 2 like more than 2 values of them whereas in one hot encoding it's like like one hot is like you know more centric towards classification like either that or not that.So, it is a 0 or 1 only 2 values will be there.",Medium"So, which one we should do?","Sir it depends like how many value how many different rows are there I mean values are there.Then let's say like you have only 2 like for classification you can prefer one hot and then for you say for regression you can do label encoding because you the range will be a lot.So, not only 2 if it's only 2 you can do one hot because either this or that for 2 values.",High"So, suppose you have categorical variables.",Okay.,NAOkay.Can you do linear regression?,"Sir if you may be encode them you can do linear regression.So, you can't do linear regression you can.Sir I am not sure actually.I think you can do regression.Now linear regression.",MediumOkay.How about dimensionality of data does it affect the model's training and behavior?,"So, like you know if your dimensionality is bigger it might take you a lot of computational time and space if it's lesser you know it'll take you lesser time to like run your model.Because the number of not only the rows even the number of columns matter because it has to be trained on all the columns right.So, lesser the number of columns I mean dimensionality it's easier to like it's it takes lesser time to train.But then if you have a more if you have a greater dimensionality your model can be more accurate.But if it's lesser you know with lesser values you cannot predict like a model accurately.",Medium"So, you have to strike a balance.",Yes sir.,NAHow did the course go for you?,"So, it went very good sir.Like it was a new subject.So, good learning it.",HighOkay.And it Feeback for me.,No sir you are very wonderful teacher.,HighThank you.,Thank you sir.,NA155 right?,"Yes sir.Sir, I'll call the next person.",HighCan you close that door please?So tell me what have you prepared?,"Sir like I prepared till clustering sir.Like I know this classification, regression and clustering will know ",Lowwhat are supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.,"Sir like in supervised we have in supervised we have regression and class, class equations sir.In unsupervised clustering,",Mediumwhy is it called supervised and why is that called unsupervised?,"In supervised we have a predefined labels like we have the whole lattice, but in clustering we do not predict anything like we have theraw data and we will like categorize the data based on the similarity.We are like do it is based on similarity.Like the similar kind of data will be plugged into one cluster sir.",MediumWhat are the different data types which we see in our attributes?,Sir qualitative and quantitative data select.,HighYes.If you have missing values how will you build that data?,"Using central tendencies like mean, median and more.So mean and median are used to fill the quantitative data, numerical data.But when it comes to qualitative data we use more.",HighOkay.What is the difference between mean and median?,"So mean is the average between all the data points.So when we are doing clustering, the mean is the mean is the centralizer.So median is the, I do not know sir.",LowWhat is the difference between bagging and boosting?,In bagging it happens parallelly while boosting happens sequentially sir.So the last final output will be dependent on the previous output sir in boosting,MediumHow does it happen sequentially?,So first the decision tree will be running sir.So the error will be minimized by passing the values into the next decision tree.So finally the error will be minimized.So if you pass the error from one distance to another the error gets minimized.,HighIs that what you are saying?,Yes sir.,NAOkay.Good.And how do you reduce dimensionality?,We can use label encoding.,HighYou can use label encoding.,When you come back to one thought encoding it increases the dimensionality.Like everything will be represented into the vector.But when it comes to label encoding the dimensionality will be intact.,HighSo you will use label encoding for all features or for the integrator?,Only the target feature.,HighWith that dimensionality will reduce.What is cosine similarity?,Like the formula sir p.q by norm p into norm q.So this jacquard and the SMC are used for only binary vectors.But this cosine singularity can be used for both binary and as well as the normal vectors.,HighWhat is the use of cosine similarity?Where can we use it?,Don't No.,NAYou know what is independence or orthogonality of vectors?What is the difference between a man or a distance and a utility and distance?,"In utility and distance the form is under root.If we have a clockwise, external external sphere is vitalized by a manhole sphere.But in",Mediummanhattan the formula changes the feature.So modulus the external external sphere is vitalized by a manhole sphere.Power is something.,,NAWhat are the performance metrics which are used for regression problem?,"where MSE, MAP, MIE.",NALet us say you measure MAP for a regression and you get the MAP value to be very large number.Very large number.Loading to infinity.What does it tell you about the model?,"When it comes to regression the error must be mean on the unlike in classification where the scores need to be higher.So if it is higher, I mean the error is higher that means the model is not predicting well, like doing well.",MediumAnd you open that data and you see for quite a lot of data the numbers are matching.Almost very close to matching.Yet the MAP is infinity.What does it tell you?,Like it here when we update the regression on the training data we got this like the error.And then when we did it on other testing data we got more MAP then that means it is over 15.And it is learning the training data way to value so that it cannot produce generalist answer.,MediumWho did the course go for you?,Well sir.,NAWhat went well?,Every thing sir.,NAAny feedback from me?,No sir.,NAThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NAYou said your number is 156.,Thank you sir.,NAWhy not?,I woke up at 8:15 when I was washing the mask out close.At 8.30 they will close.,Low"Okay, what is your project?",Our project is based on impact of non-text code elements.,HighWhat kind of problem is it?,Basically it is a problem where you have code no sir.,MediumWhich part of the code is most prefer to get a mask call?,A lot of the marks which are part of the code is most important.,High"Right.
So whatever you are doing in your project can you put that as a block diagram or something?",A step by step.,MediumEither you name the steps or put it as a block diagram.,"Sir, sir yours.",NA"that's fine 
What is the first step?","Step 1 means we converted to raw data, we can put it into embedding some.Four columns.",MediumWhy do you do it?,"For reduced dimensions.
It is all text data sir.
It has high-dimensional.
So to reduce our dimension.",High"Why do you say text data is high-dimensional?
What is the dimension of the text data?
You don't know.
But you are confidently saying it is high.","Not confidently
Not much.",Medium"Okay, one confidently.
Okay, less confidently we are saying that because I have a dimension.
How can we justify that?","Why I am doing project?
Why I ask my team at he told that converting embedding into it will reduce dimensions.",MediumWhat is the dimensionality of your reduced dimensionality value?,"Basically it has lot of columns.
By reducing into embedding we got only 256 columns.
That means code with logic, code with the commons, code with solution.
All 256 are imaginary to 256.
Before that it has lot of questions.
Repeated questions are there.
Repeated questions only one amending is there.",High"Okay.
So you converted it into embedding?",T5 embedding,NA"All right.
And T5 gave you 256 embedding.",I think it is 256.,MediumBut you are confidently saying it is high.,All 256 are imaginary to 256.,High"Okay.
And after that what did you do?
We imagined one data set sir, one target column.
After that we perform regression.
You perform regression.
How do you measure the performance of regression models?","Evolution matrices, R square error and root matrix.
root matrix.
R square error percentage.
R square percentage.",HighWhat is the difference between R square and error percentage?,R square error is 1 minus RSS by total sum square.,High"What is RSS?
RSS?Can a write form?",Can a write form?,Medium"Yes.
All right.
Now suppose you are normalizing the write.
You know what is normalize sir?",NO,NA"All right.
Suppose you have missing values in your data.
How will you fill it?
How do you reduce dimensionality?","No idea.
Only PCS was used.",Medium"What is cosine similarity?
What does BN give?
No idea.
Okay.
How did the course go for you?",Well,NAAnd if anyfeedback for me?,Good,NA"You good?
Thank you very much.","This is the first time we are doing it.
I was the first time by spreading it back",High"Good.
I hope you learned something.",Yes.,NA"Aditya, what is your role number Aditya?",160 sir.,NA160.Yes.What is your project?,Stacking models of cluster.,HighWhat is stacking model?,"Stacking model is just you are doing clustering again and again on data set to get more accuracy.Like I do clustering, I take one data set which isunlabeled for clustering.I, we do this four algorithms we apply to that, we get an output for that again we do grid search.So that we get an at last we get that labeled of clustering.For that again we use meta clustering.We do again these four things to get better accuracy at the last.",MediumSo how do you measure accuracy of clustering?,"We are taking three evaluation metrics, Siliot index, David and Kilansky.Siliot is like it is best for large data sets.",HighOkay.,"But Davidson is, it is ratio of within clusters and in between clusters.Kilansky is just like opposite of that.That is in between cluster ratio of between clusters and within cluster.David, David index the less is better.These remaining Siliot and Kilansky the more accuracy the more value the more accurate and more better cluster.",MediumOkay.Suppose your input vectors are in a high dimensional space.That is the number of features are very high.How does it affect clustering?,It affect for large data set and high dimensional space.K means can be used.K means algorithm can be used.,MediumWhat about other algorithms?,"hey can be used but K means is very like efficient for large data set.But it has disadvantage that it is sensitive to outlayers.So for that we use K media media, it's that is robust outlayers.Same as K means.Then again we have other we are using GMM.That is a probabilistic clustering.It feeds this all data.It feeds the all data sets to various Gaussian distributions.Then I have a DB scan also sir.It is density based.And it is density based for large data set useful.But if you take hierarchical that is tree based you will get dendogram.It can be used.But if you take large data set it affects that because dendogram will be very thick.",MediumOkay.What is complete linkage?,No idea.,NA"Okay.Alright.So, let's say you have data and then you realize that the ranges of the attributes are in different values.So, you normalize it.This process of normalization would it affect your cluster formation in the vector space?",Yes sir.,NAWhy?,"Because data, it is having different data attribution types.",HighRight.,"But when we are normalizing it.We are reducing that redundancy.We are reducing that difference.So, while clustering because we will take different set for testing and training.Then again for different types you do we use algorithms.It affects accuracy at the last.",HighWhat accuracy?,Index it changes.To tell to be precise it reduces the accuracy.,LowIt reduces the accuracy.,No sir.After normalization it increases the accuracy.,HighWhat do you mean by increases the accuracy?,"It like before normalization clustering formation will be delayed and this evaluation matrix values will be very less.After normalization clustering will be done easily.So, that this values will be higher.",MediumAll the values will go up?,"No sir.Ciliate will go up.David will be.David I have no idea sir.But, Kalansky will go up but not as drastically as Ciliate.",Medium"Okay.So, you have got an input data set and there are missing values in it.As well as there are some values which are categorical.What all steps you will take so that you can do clustering on it?","First, we should fill those missing values either by for if the missing values are there its numerical values should be there.We will take mean or median.If it is categorical it is better to take mode.Taking mode of that we can fill those missing values then we can do cluster.",HighThat is what missing values.But you also have categorical values.,Okay.I thought it is missing in categorical.If it is missing in categorical we will use mode.But if it has categorical we will just drop that column.,HighYou will drop the column.Wouldn't it reduce the dimensionality?,Yes sir.I have no idea how to change your categorical.,HighSo because you have no idea you will drop it.Okay.Right.So because you have no idea you will drop it.Can you tell me.What is the dimensionality?,Yes sir.I have no idea how to change your category.,High"So because you have no idea you will drop it.Okay.Right.Can you tell me.Sir, why he has not calculated the critical.You have studied about distance metric and similarity metrics right.",Yes.,NAHow about the path of the event.So when we are doing DB scan algorithm which of these matrices are we using?,Similarity matrix.,NASimilarity.How?,DB scan is density based and it checks the similarities between these clustering sir.,HighSo you are saying density gets determined based on similarity?Can you explain how DB scan algorithm is executed?Or what does the algorithm do?,No sir.I guess for this DB scan.It divides the data and uses for clustering but I don't know how the division thing exactly works.It divides the data and does clustering.,HighWhat do you mean by divides the data?Does it divide it into two?,No.It divides the data and does clustering.,HighDoes it divide it into two sets?Multiple sets?,"I forgot sir, this DB scan and diagonal GMM I forgot.This is a border for the different source to write it.",MediumOk. You have any feedback for me?,"Nothing sir, course was good but I learnt things.It was very useful for this thing and when I was doing data science also all this, this dendrograms all these were useful.So I could use this concept, this plotting and distributions also.",HighOk.Thank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA"I am not.Why not?Tens, huh?",Yes.,NAWhy?,"I don't know sir, I generally have that fear.",HighExample here?,Yes.,NAOkay.Don't worry.You would have got the information from your friends what kind of questions I am asking.,"Yes sir, but I was preparing for it before.",HighOkay.All right.So where do you want me to ask you questions from?,"Sir, KNN classification, linear regression,",HighKNN classification and linear regression.,Yes sir.,NA"Okay.Right.So, in what?Can you give one example problem statement where you can use linear regression and another example where you should use KNN classification?","Okay sir.So, for regression, like if we want to like we are in a software office or in a corporate office and we want to like predict like maybe the age of the persons working there based on their income, their position, based on income then we can use linear regression.Like since it is like continuous values we use linear regression.And if it is like any categorical values then we can use classification like same example if we want to like classify based on positions.We can use these numerical matrix like salary age, salary age and some other numerical matrix to classify the mass positions like whichever is close we can use KNN classification and put them try to predict their position.",MediumVery good.What is K in KNN?,KNN is the hyperparameterature like in KNN we can choose like up to how many positions we have to consider like if there are KNNs 4 we can choose the top 4 the closeness possible like we can consider the top 4 which are coming under KNN.And based on that majority in those 4 we can classify them sir.,MediumVery good.So you know what is data normalization?,"Yes, sir",NAwhat is it?,"Data normalization is basically we have ranges for our data.If you want to normalize them like from if you want to get that data to less range like 0, 1 between 0 to 1 we can use or any other under any other brackets we can use normalization sir.Generally we use that for outlayers.",HighSo suppose there is a data set and you do not normalize it.How will it affect KNN?,Data not normal outlayers sir..If there are outlayers and affecting the KNN then we can normalize.We can use g square normalization.,MediumBut you do not normalize then what will happen?,If you do not normalization do normalize then we can get wrong answers.,MediumWhy?,Because since the data point may be far away from rest of the other data points.So just based on that only that particular value or that particular column or value it might like it do not get tells.It might affect the other features like because of one feature it might affect all other features which might not be that much necessary as compared to other features.So like that it can affect.,HighVery good.So how do you measure the performance of a classifier?,Classifier accuracy precision recall.Contribution matrix.Contribution matrix.,MediumWhat is the difference between precision and recall?,Precision has actually predicted as precision sir.Correctly predicted as precision sir.And recall is correctly predicted positive as precision sir and wrongly predicted positive is recall.,MediumSo that is positive negative.If you have multi class.,Like I did not get it sir.,MediumSuppose there are many classes not two.,I am not sure sir.,MediumIs high dimensional data good or bad?,It might be bad like increasing the number of features like increasing number of features which are not necessary like can affect the outcome.,MediumSo can you you know what is unsupervised learning?,Yes.Unsupervised learning for example clustering sir.So like for supervised learning we have like labeled data.Like we know we have sample dataset and you know what to predict and how to predict.And for like clustering we do not know what to predict.We just basically have the features of data points and we through iterations.Through our iterations we perform the closeness and all until the clusters are not moving to find out to predict patterns.,HighSo clustering is unsupervised.,,NAYes sir.Okay.That is right.,Yes.Unsupervised.Unsupervised.Unsupervised.,Medium,,NA,Okay.,NASo how will the course go for you?,Sir actually to be honest starting I didn't find it quite interesting sir but while proceeding with the projects and last hackathon was actually it boosted my confidence sir.Like I actually without any help.Like I one could develop a model.I could successfully train and test a model.Like others were work mode different models and I could work on my own model and it was actually working so it gave me a bit confidence.,NAParticipated more hackathons.,Yes.,HighSo that it will boost your confidence as joys are evident.,Yes sir.,NAOkay.,Yes.,NAAnd if it back for me.,Yes sir.,NAYeah.,You can be a little louder sir in the class.,NAThank you.,Thank you sir.,High"So, we are as whatever we studied.",Yes sir everything except the last few parts I have studied everything.,HighI mean whatever prepared well for the virus.,Okay I know KNN then the normalization then recreation model and clustering.,Highvery good.What is the difference between clustering and classification?,The classification we the clusters are defined.The number of clusters are given already.In that cluster when the data is taken data point we have to just categorize it between those clusters which are given.But in clustering what we do is we make the clusters from the given data set.That is the difference.,MediumWhy do we make clusters?,Because some data points are related like the distance between some data points is less and that am is how to handle.Some group of data they have distance between them is almost less.And compared to other kind of data which is more.So basically if we see a graph then they are already forming two clusters.So that is how it goes.,MediumYeah that is how it is done.Why is it done?,Why clusters are why we are making clusters?,MediumWhy we are making clusters?,Okay why we are making clusters?Because data points represent something.I mean if they are forming a cluster that is giving us some data about the cluster.I mean the how are the data points?What they have in common?So that is required for us then like for prediction maybe this cluster with some weightage and the other one with some weightage will give us the profit prediction.That is why we are making clusters to analyze data.,HighVery good.,Thank you.,NAThat is good.And how do you measure the performance of a clustering algorithm?,"Of a clustering algorithm.You mean the silhouettes go around the building?Yes sir.So these are the two criteria in silhouettes go what we do?We find the average of in one cluster we find a we take a data point and compare to all the data points of that cluster with the formula BI, BI minus AI upon minimum of BI comma AI.Well that is the formula basically.And what is AI?AI is the distance between your this one data point of one cluster to the other data point.And in the formula what we are doing here?They are multiple clusters right.So which one is the nearest to this cluster which has having the data point?So we take that.",HighVery good.Can you tell me one scenario where clustering will fail?,Clustering will fail.Clusters.,LowYou may not be able to farm.,Yes sir.Yes so that can happen when clusters are either overlapping the form constant circles or they are varying near to each other.In which we are in case we are not able to form a particular I mean linear line between the two clusters.We are not able to differentiate between the two clusters.,HighSo that is okay fine.Okay so let us say you have data which is available to you with all categorical variables.,Okay.,NACan you use it for cluster?,Yes sir.With the categorical data we can directly meet the clusters because every data point they are forming I mean there will be three or four categories or number I mean the specified categories.So we can form directly a cluster based on the category.Like cluster is category that does not mean.,HighWhat kind of cluster in algorithm will you use?,For this one.Clustering algorithm.Okay.Because give will represent the different distinct categories.,MediumOkay.Right.So suppose you have lot of missing values in the data.Right.What do you do?,"In a clustering problem if you ask me if a cluster and that data points are having many missing values.So they can have two things.One is global mean average, mean medium mode.I can take orders based on the cluster.If some data point is belonging to one cluster.So what is the mean of that cluster itself?I can take that value.",HighBut your data is missing value.How will you prove it?,Okay.In the first place only.,HighRight.,So the one is if it is category will I will find the mode.,HighOkay.,I will fill it.If it is this one numerical without outliers.Without outliers I will take mean.And without outliers I will take medium.,MediumSo when you are feeling these missing values with central tendencies.How will it affect your clustering?,So I don't think it will affect much.Just a minute here and there it will be there.Because at the end what we are giving what we are assigning the value to it.Is something which is already forming a cluster.So it won't make a lot of difference.I mean it won't be like I have found something for the data point which is related to this cluster.And if I have a fail of missing value for that.Okay.Okay.Okay.There can be one or the number of missing data points.It can be a scenario where a data point which is belonging to cluster A but it is showing a cluster B.This can happen because maybe that one because we are finding if we are finding mean.And it is also possible that something which belongs to this cluster may go to that cluster also.So this can be the scenario.So there are many missing data points and this scenario can be created.,MediumThat is very good and you did very well.,Thank you.,NAHow did you find the course?,I was very grateful.I mean course I already liked it.I started it previously.But then you were also teaching very good.So I got interested in that.,HighAnd it could back for me.,No sir.,NAOn where is how it came into.,No sir.It was great.,NAThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NAWhat is your project?,"So my project is vector and ductitation of multiple solutions to the same question.
So we have used Plustering, we have collected code letter and vectorized it using code T5 plus model, then dimensional to reductionist and using human, to avoid cursor dimensionality.
And then different Plustering algorithms has been applied to identify how the Plustering is going to happen.
Right.
This is our real thing.",High"Right.
Thank you.
So why are you using Plustering?","So the Plustering is like when you have different solutions to the same question.
And we don't have any like target variable in our data set.
So that is the first one to be noted.
And there are similar multiple solutions that are correct solutions.
So we expect that all the multiple solutions have a similar pattern actually.
Similar pattern in the sense like they have similar way of answering similar syntax, similar logic.
So when we convert it into a vector space, so all vector space are expected to be together.
So to identify whether they are together and when multiple solutions are combined, is still whether they are still together or they are sparse.
Is what the main objective and why we are using Plustering is like Plustering actually groups the similar things based on the patterns.
So that's why we have used it in the Plustering.",High"Very good.
How do we measure the performance of a Plustering algorithm?","So we have different performance metrics like we used to calculate the quality, compactness and all that.
But in our project we don't have that proof levels.
So we used only Kerenzky-Hargoy's Darius-Boldin and Sillhaut score.
Sillhaut score indicates whether this particular point belongs to this cluster and not to that any other cluster.
Whereas in Kerenzky-Hargoy's, Kerenzky-Hargoy's is the variance of within cluster, ratio within cluster and to the other clusters.
Whereas in Darius-Boldin, the interclass distance and interclass distance between one cluster, we should have less distance.
And on cluster to another cluster, we should have more distance for the compactness like to be very clear.",High"Suppose instead of clustering you are doing classification, would you use the same performance metric or you will change it","Yeah, we will change it.
And moreover, the classification is not suitable for our project titles.
Classification is not a tool that we have to, our project title is not classified or project title is to identify pattern.
Whether it is matched or not.",High"Wonderful.
So you did embedding, right?
Why did you do embedding?","So like when you have a code data, you can't directly feed the TOA model.
Because if you, if I want to train a model, I have to give a point such that the data, such that mission should interpret the data.
So when I give a native vector space, if I point that vector into a vector space, such that my model can visualize the dimensionality and it can train from it.
And directly if I give the code, it means it cannot interpret.
So what we did is we converted into vectors that is mission understandable form, instead of end-dimensional, 256 dimension and the dimension reduction is using Luma.",High"All right.
So now please tell me",Yes,NATell me some of the advantages of this embedding,Yes.,NA"Whatever embedding.
Embedding is a process.",Yes.,NATell me some advantages of embedding and some disadvantages of embedding.,"So first I would like to go with the disadvantages of the embedding.
Like when we have different embedding models.
In particular, we are dealing with codes.
So I would like to talk in the perspective of code only.
Code word, code T5, code T5 plus models are different code embedding.
Some of the code embedding models, where math word is used for math equations or not that thing.
This advantage is like in particular project, what we identified is we do not know exactly how embedding has been created by this particular embedding model.
Means how based on which particular logic or it is creating or based on programming languages that embedding has been generated.
We are at two.
We cannot classify that whether this is done based on this particular thing.
This is done based on this particular thing.
But similar questions are together similar vectors are formed.
But how the vectors have been formed?
We have not greatly explored in that particular area.
And then when you asked about the adorn and one more disadvantage is like when one of our project object to is to identify whether the embedding is a language dependent or language independent.
In our final emphasis, this inference is that it is language independent based on logic only.
It is getting vectorized.
So I would like to say that it is an advantage part based on similar things, respect of different languages.
It is creating a similar vector space, plot in a similar vector space.",High"So let us talk about the disadvantage.
You said that you are not knowing how the embedding is getting formed is a disadvantage.
Is that a disadvantage for the model?
That is disadvantage, your ignorance can be made.","For model it is not a disadvantage.
For our interpretation it is understood.",HighI am asking about the disadvantage of the process,"It means it is creating a dimensional dimensional space.
So that self after creating an dimensional space, like this particular code is represented in a 256 column.
We have to again apply a dimensional detection technique.
I think that might be a disadvantage.",MediumWhich one?,Because it gives us an enlarged dimensionality in which model can't be a computational cost increases,High"So you are saying embedding generates high dimensional vectors, so that is a disadvantage.",And some of the embeddings are two high dimensional elements.,HighNow can you tell me what is an assumption we make while using nav base classifier?,"Nav base classifier, each and every point is assumed that it is true.
It is a nav based.",HighAnd which model is the sequentiality of events?,"You are asking about the bagging or boosting like that.
Boosting uses a sequential process where different models are.
Previous model takes use of output and that output is given as input.",HighSo let us understand that,"And you are asking about stacking regression like that of the model.
That is headcountristic.",High"Let us talk about boosting.
So you said that boosting uses a sequentiality that is output upon model is free to the other model.
How does that happen?","So when you like different boosting or boosting algorithms are there.
In which first we are actually feeding the input to the one particular model.
And then output, that output generated contains some misclassified labels.
So we are feeding that misclassified labels into the next model.
It is that it learns from the previous mistakes and it produces a better result.",High"And you are very excited.
You are feeding only the misclassified labels.",And the sequentiality is complete output to your feed along with the mislabeled information,HighHow is your different from bagging?,"So bagging actually like we have a data set.
We will be treating it and we will be training the parallelism.
It is the parallelism.
We are training different models.
And then at last we are using the voting we are getting the results.
We are using boosting instead of a sequential action where it is a parallel action.
To get a multiple models at range, best result is at it.",High"Okay.
So how do you basically normalize data?","Normalization.
Like let us say you have 100 rows of data in which some of the features are having an outliers.
So we have to normalize outliers.
We have to reduce the outlier range.
So we are using different technique like minmax normalization and Z-score normalization to reduce the outlier range of the outliers.
Whereas in Z-score or robust to the outliers, minmax are sensitive to the outliers.
Z-score cannot remove the complete outlier range but it reduces the range.
Minmax means we are having the specifying the minummon wise boundary.",High"Very good.
Now say you have normalized data.",Yes.,NA"Or else you did not normalize.
There are two scenarios.",Yes.,NA"You did not normalize.
You did not normalize.
You did not normalize.
How will the silhouite coefficient between these two scenarios change?",Silhouite project matrix,NA"You can talk either CHI or DVI or silhouite whichever.
So I have normalization.
Whichever is your favorite.
But you suppose you do not normalize.
How will it change the index?","Minmax did not normalize.
There are outlier points.
So when I plot that outlier point into the vector space, it is completely different.
And then when I particular silhouite score range was, it is like particular to this particular crystal, not to that particular crystal.
Not have completed answer.
Like I can't defend this in this particular scenario.
You have a can't think of that way.",High"No problem.
How did the course go for you?","Yes, that's fine sir.
I feel good.
But little part that I feel is like neural networks and perceptron area.
I didn't understood it well.
That's the only backlog in it I have.
Other things I have at the start.
Neural networks as I know.
But if you ask me anything in this way, I couldn't have answered anything.
That's the fun of the disadvantage that I have in neural networks and perceptron.
Even I got good marks in the video because of that particular section only.
I didn't able to recognize that.",HighWhy did you not come and ask?,"You should have come and ask sir.
But my project area is not in that way and due to the other constant areas, I couldn't able to read it to that particular extent.
I couldn't able to focus.
I mean rest of the things, like from starting part and then last week, discuss some of the topics.
As we have an organization, the cost of damage, which is relevant to my topic and other courses also like data sense and all that.
So I feel it's fine.
Very good.
Come back to that.
Okay.",High"What is your feedback for me?
How can I improve?
For yourself.
I give feedback for you.","Yes.
If it's difficult to ask for me to give feedback to you.
No, I don't work out.",HighYou can give me so that I can improv,"I don't say it as a backlog, but so when last name of Ben students are sitting there, they couldn't able to hear yourself.
That's the one thing I sit for.
I can hear you.
But in first two semesters, I used to sit back.
So when faculties are not saying not that loud, even though I have wanted to listen to the class because I couldn't able to hear.
I generally make attention girls, not to sound that.
I think I address these things in the class many times.
But I think we have to work it on it.
I think because when you're in large class and we have 80 students of student nearly, large students definitely they can't able to hear what you're seeing.",HighSure.,"That's one thing, sir.
That's not the case.
Thank you very much.",HighOkay.,"It's a round.
I have one question.",HighSure,"So next semester, I just not a person.
Not a person.",High"So, is there a specific concept on which you want me to ask you questions?",Like matrix.,NAWhat is the difference matrix which are used for regression?,"For regression, F1 score, accuracy, precision, these are the matrixes for regression.",High"So, we use F1 score, accuracy for regression or classification.","For classification also sir, because while classification we even need to know the model performance.
So, we use the accuracy if for the models performance, we use accuracy, precision took because we should tell if the data which we are pitching is a precise or not like if it is perfect or not.","So, what is regression?","Regression is the, sir it is a method of grouping of grouping data into different, into different sub data sets without knowing its prior information.
Like for example, classification works like if there are five number of vehicles of different companies but different models.
So, we are going to group if it is Toyota, we are going to group the models, all the models related to Toyota company in the one dataset.
And other company vehicles into another dataset that is classification.
But in regression, we do not see like whether it is of this company or what, we will see that if it is a car or not and we divide it into a car or it is a bike or it is a truck like that.",High"So, suppose I am trying to predict the temperature of the day.
What kind of problem is that?","Temperature of the day.
We are taking the input and adding output to the regression, sir.",High"So if I am trying to say whether it is a car or not that is also a regression and if I am predicting temperature that is also a regression.
","No sir.If you are predicting the temperature, I do not know sir, I will be sorry.",MediumIs regression a supervised learning problem or on supervised learning problem?,"It is a supervised learning problem, sir.
Because if there are types in regression, the linear regression and multiple regression and another types.
In linear, we take only x and y that is input and output.
Through that, we are going to sort the data.
That is very simple.
But using the other regression techniques can make our data more efficient and we can fetch our data more efficiently.",High"So let us say that temperature prediction is a problem and you said that is regression.
How will you, let us say you have predicted temperature for 10 days.
How will you find a score for this prediction?
You recall that you said a score is a performance metric for regression, right?
Can you help me understand how will you calculate a score for a temperature prediction which has been done for let us say 10 days?","No sir, I do not know this.
Do not know this.",Medium"Okay.
Now suppose your data is fluctuating too much.
Okay.
From day to day it is very much changing, right?
Yes sir.
Will there be any problem when you are trying to build a regression model?","Yes, it will be a problem.
Suppose when we are trying to fetch the output, suppose on the day one we are going to predict that it is going to be sunny.
But like according to the temperature like other sources it will change.
So the model, the model's accuracy will decrease and the precision will also decrease which also decreases the performance of the model.
And it cannot fetch the exact, like it cannot fetch the exact details of that day.",High"Is there any regression model which takes sequentially of events into consideration?
Sequentially, like what did I predict before is going to affect what time going to predict now?","Yeah.
Asking the type of regression, sir",Low"Yes.
Or the name of a model, which tells this?","Forgot its names like some logistic regression, something it is there, sir.
Like it checks the before predicted value and it will also check the value which we are going to obtain.
It checks both of them so that we are going to get a perfect value of the middle one, the predicted output as well as the output we got after predicted and the exact value.
Yes.
Like that.
I forgot its names as a model's name.",HighNow you have heard of what is called as a decision tree.,"Yes, sir",NAWhat is a decision tree?,"Decision tree.
Suppose it has branches.
For example, we are going to give a loan to a person.
We are going to check his credit score and his income details.
So these are all the branches in a tree.
The total branches, like we cannot predict, but we can tell that if a person want to take a loan, one branch is for his income, one branch is for his credit score, one branch is for his minimum balance and that's all.
So we are going to check whether his income is greater than 50,000 or 80,000.
He can be approved for educational loan or he can be approved for any other loan.
So we are going to set some values.
So in decision tree, through all the branches, we are going to tell if the person is eligible or not.
It is eligible to take these all factors into consideration.",High"That is a decision.
Can you use a decision tree for regression problem?",No.,NA"Suppose you want to build a tree for a regression purpose.
What would it be called as?",Decision tree for regression purpose,Low"Okay, let's talk about decision tree.
What is the effect of normalizing data on decision tree?","The effect of normalizing data.
So like in what terms, sir?",HighI didn't understand your question,"In what terms, it can be normalized, sir.",Medium"You know what is data normalization, sir?","Yes, sir.",NAWhat is it?,"Sir, like we are going to sort the data based on the data we have.
Like we are going to, how should I say it, sir?
I am not getting into say it, sir.",High"No problem.
Any questions for me?",nothing,NAHow did the course move for you?,"Very good, sir.
Very well.",LowAny feedback for my improvement,"Very good.
You are teaching me everything is good, sir.",Medium"Okay.
Thank you very much.","Thank you, sir.",NA"Do all the character classes have same number of samples in their dataset?
You have different characters, for example your training right?",Yes,NA,,"Do all the characters have same number of characters, samples?
On the character scene?",No sir.,NA"They have different number of some different ones.
So is that a class balanced problem or a class imbalance problem?
Balance or problem sir?",It is a class balanced set.,Medium"Classes are balanced.
When they are not same.
Then what is class imbalance problem?","Accuracy.
So for the balance set we use, I'll accuracy once.",High"But my question is when the number of samples present in your dataset vary from one class to another too much, is that a class balanced set or a class imbalance set?
So when it varies it is an imbalance set.","Is that your problem?
Is that the same thing you are experiencing in your project?
But no sir.
Like we have extracted the guber features and we fed in the HMO model.
But we are predicting the character is predicting but it is predicting the wrong character like it is randomly taking from the training dataset.
Can ",MediumCan you tell me what is the full form of HMOWhat is the work of model?,"There are various components in the states.
Then the initial probability matrix moves the transition matrix.
So these are the components.",High"What is transition matrix?
So what is initial probability?",So like it will be given the matrix and the rows will be like a dimension that filled with 0.,High"But it is filled with 0 that is initial probability.
Marks you up.
So let us say you have trained your HMM.
How will you measure how good the HMM is?
What are the performance matrix used for classification?
Performance matrix.
The distance matrix.","Equally distance, man hat and distance.
Can you write the formula for equilibrium distance in n dimensional space?
Equally.
Okay.",Medium"Are you missing something there?
1 by n. 1 by n. What is n?","The n dimensional space.
So you divide it by 1 by n. You will get an distance.
So like only XM and Sway are going to go.",HighDo you put a 1 by n?,Let it not there,LowHow did the course go for you?,"Like machine learning I learnt it very good sir.
Like they understood how the machine learns and all.
Actually it is a loop for me.
It is a good experience like learning and seeing.
Like we are training the machine.
We are learning like making the machine understand Ganga Timur.",HighCan you give some feedback for my improvement?,"For all things I didn't do good in that class.
Can you point out?
It is not like that sir.
But for me, the explanation part I am just for sir.
But for me when it is visualized I can understand a bit.
It is clear sir now.
But for me if it is visualized then I will be remembering.
No I don't.
But the explanation is for remembering.
But if it is visualized then it will be easy for me.
On this way.",MediumThank you very much.,"166th.
Thank you.",NA" Okay, so how have you been prepared for VIVA ?","Sir, I have gone through most of the topics and mainly gone through the topics before the medicine.",HighOkay.And your project is on what?,Weighted regression. Code evalution,Medium"Okay, very good So, which of the regression models you have used?","Sir, we have used XG Boost, Cod Boost, Adah, Boost and then random forest and then we also tried stacking",HighStacking.,"Stacking with, with end point regression, Scad.",MediumHow are you measuring the regression output?,For the stacking.,MediumFor the many of them.,"Okay, sir, for matrix, we are using MA and R square.",HighMA and R square. What is the difference between these two?,"Sir, MA compares, it compares the actual and predicted value and then it means it and then R square is, it checks how close it is to the actual values.It is that, considers the predicted and actual and the mean of the actual values.",HighAll right. What are the different data normalization techniques are you familiar with?,"Data normalization, min, max and Z square.",MediumWhat is the difference between these two?,"Min, max can be used for changing the range of it and Z square is main views when we want to shift it to range of minus 1 to 1 and we can also use it to find out.If there outside the threshold of minus 1 to 1, we can consider observation to be out of the measure.",High" So, what does one be, what I mean, what becomes of the mean and variance of the data after mean mass normalization?
","Mean shifts with the data, variance remains the same.",High"It means, max normalization.","Yes.I mean, mean shifts with the data and variance remains the same.Variance?",HighWhat do you mean by variance?,"I think variance will also be, yes, it will be",Mediumright,"But it would not be a linear shift, it will be a root, you know, it will be shifted or not sure about the relation of the shifting, but it will be, well it seems.",HighWhat do you know about cosine similarity?,"So, cosine similarity, it is like similarity between two observations, using the magnitude and magnitude of the observation and we can use it for non binary vectors also.",HighWe can use it for non binary vectors.Where do we use it and for what purpose?,"We can, we can use it for finding similarity between two observations comparing.",MediumSo we find similarity.,"Yes.I mean, mean shifts with the data and variance remains the same.Variance?",HighAnd we find difference that is in distance.,yes ,NA"So, where do we use similarity, where do we use distance?","I think this similarity mostly, okay, similarity here.Distance mostly for smaller dimensionalities and similarities more useful for higher dimensionalities.",HighWhat are parameters and hyper parameters?,"So, parameters are the direct part which control the output and we cannot change them much, but hyper parameters are controllable parameters which we can use to tune them.",High"So, parameters you can change.","But they would, they have an ideal value.",High"Can you take a model example and excellent, maybe tell what is the parameter, what is the hyper parameter?","It is a KN and KN and K can be the hyper parameter which we can change and that is it for regression parameters would be this low and C value.We do change it, but it is fixed in the ideas in that.",HighWhat is an activation function?,"Activation function can be used to convert a value because sending it to the perceptron, before sending it to perceptron.",HighWhy do we use it?,Maybe to regularize the input.,MediumWhat do we mean by regularize?,Let's say we have negative and non-negative values.Then we can use something like sigma function to convert it to 1 and 0 and then send it.,HighWhat did the course go for you?,well sir,NAWhat one?,I enjoy making the parameters.I am very interested in it.,High"Anything, any feedback for me on how to improve?",no sir,NAThank you very much.,thanks,NADid you have breakfast?,Yes.,NA"Okay.
What is your role, number?",22157,NA"Okay.
Alright.
What is your project?","A separating question, the answer is from the viva entrance test.",HighWhat kind of problem is it?,Like the way we have done it,Medium" separate question, answer, what kind of problem is it?
Is it a classification problem, a regression problem, a clustering problem, what is it?","Like it is a classification of questions, answers and statements, classification.",HighIs that a supervised learning or unsupervised learning?,"Like, supervised are we labeled it",Medium"You labeled.
Yes.
Why do you call it supervised?","Because we are assigning the target or attribute as a question or statement or answer for every input variable.
You are assigning whether it is question or answer or statement for every variable.",HighThat is why it is supervised learning,"Like, we are labeling, labeled data",MediumIt is labeled data,"Like, we are labeling us",Medium"So, why is it called supervised learning?
What super vision is happening there?
Because I am checking whether you are labeling it properly or not.
Is that why it is supervised learning?",NO sir,NAThen why is it called supervised learning?,"Like, checking the accuracy on it will get another label that is correct or not.
Like, we will be able perfectly or not",Medium"So, whether the labeling is perfect or not, that someone is checking, that is why it is supervised learning.","So, the way is, if the input variable is having the set in target variable.
If the values are having, if the values are having the set in data points.",Medium"So, if you have the set in data points, then it is not possible to have the set in data points.","It will not be class.
It will be in the range without outliers.",High"Just by inputing data, it will make it out no outliers","Like, not more difference.",Medium"How can you give an example and explain?
Okay.
What are the different classifiers you have used for your problem?","Random forest.FC BOOST ,SVM I used these four.",HighCan you explain how random forest works?,"Like, assembling of decision trees and getting the output",High"Okay.
How?
You are saying random forest contains lots of decision trees","Like, I am assembling of a decison trees to give the output.",High"So, how do these decision trees generate multiple decision trees, generate one output?","I am doing this.
I am doing this.
I am doing this.",Low"If you keep quiet, you are just wasting time.","Yes, sir.",NA"Then you should tell you don't know.
I am happy to sit silently once or ten minutes or over.","No, sir",NA"Okay.
What is the effect of dimensionality on the random forest?","If the dimensional detection is happening in the random forest, the original variable is faster",HighHow do you reduce dimensionality?,Removing the independent variables regarding the target value.,High"You will get rid of remove the 11 attributes.
How do you find out if that variable is relevant or irrelevant?",By checking the relationship between the target,HighAnd how do you check that relationship?,I don't know,NAYou don't know,Okay,NA"Now, what is margin in SVM?",No idea,NA"Okay.
How do you find out if two vectors are independent of each other or not?",Checking the linear relationship between,LowHow do you check the linear relationship?,"If the values increase in this variable also, that is concept",MediumHow do you check?,Yes.,NA"Okay.
Hi.
How did the course go for you?",Good.,NAWhat was good about the course?,My relation pattern is quite different compared to other courses.,High"So, that was good or bad?",That was good,NAHow?,"As per me, I did both in like for the quizzes and hackathon, I participated in everything if the hackathon is not containing any marks, I would have not participated.
Because of this evolution pattern, I participated and I tried my level best on that thing.
And I got to know I can also do a nice at start.
Good.",HighAnd if you did back for me?,No.,NAWhat is your role on the once again?,So 165.,NA"Yes, or something?
Please tell me, where should I ask you questions from?","Just like, I have a brief idea before the mid, my project topics and",Low" You have brief idea before the mid-sem and no idea after mid-sem.
So, you have brief idea after mid-sem and brief idea before mid-sem.","like mid-sem and no, you know, better before mid-sem.",MediumCan you explain how we constructed decision tree?,"Yes.
Okay",NACan you tell me what to... How will you evaluate whether two vectors are independent or not?,"Two vectors are independent or not?
Sorry, sorry.",MediumWhat is rank of a matrix?,"So, rank of a matrix after converting it to the  eigen values form and reduction after that will get a form.",HighWhat for?,"So, like after reducing it to this first, so I don't exactly remember that name.
That first in the...
If it's a three cross three matrix, the first like two into one row and the...
The three into one and three into two should be zero, sir.
After converting in the non-zero rows or the rank of the matrix, sir.",Medium"Suppose you have a three by three matrix.
What are the different possible rank values can I guess?","So, like, zero, one... And... You can have a zero rank, you can have a one rank and... Two rank, two rank.",Low"That's all.
Can it have a three rank?","Rank three can't have, sir.
It becomes an all matrix, sir.
It becomes an all matrix if it is rank three.
Like, all the...
If all the values are zero, then it becomes...
If all the values are zero, then it is rank three.
Sir, no, sir.
Like, if there are no zero or non-zero rows, then it becomes a rank three, ",Low"If there are no non-zero rows, then it becomes rank three.
Okay.
So, based on your experience with project, sir.
Do you find that data to have zero rows or non-zero rows?","Sir, like, as of now, we were having a bit of missing data values, sir.
You were having missing data, sir.
Okay, now data, sir.
So, we cleared it using this easel and fill in it.
Then, sir, can I get you a question once again?",Medium"Based on your project data, sir.
Do you see there are zero rows?","Yes, sir.
There are a wide zero rows?
No, sir.
There were no completely zero rows, but a few attributes of the rows were missing, sir.
You attributes are missing.",MediumHow many attributes did you have?,"Sir, or total of, like, our data set consisted of, like, total... We're having 2,600 data sets, sir.
That's for training.
And in that, we were having attributes around, like, some 10 to 20... 20, I don't exactly know, sir.",Medium"Okay, let's set 20 attributes.
And 2,600 rows.
Yes, sir.
What would be the rank of this matrix?
And you said that there was no...
There were no non-zero rows","Yes, sir.
So, what would be the rank of this matrix?
Sir, when you were, like, if it would be 2,600... 2,000 rows, like, no, 1,000 rows, no... Like, none of the columns are zero, not... Rank zero.
Rank is zero, sir.
So, the rank of your training set is zero.
Yes, sir.",MediumWhat is your project?,"So, segmentation-free character recognition.",High"Is character recognition a... What kind of problem it is?
Classification problem.
Why?","So, like, we are considering this order, this manuscript, sir.
That the images we are processing into, we are... We are more training the model to identify it and classify it in the same form as the training data sets.",MediumWhy is it a classification problem?,"Sir, like, the data...
So, manuscripts, like, we are classifying it, sir.
Like, we are refining it and we are classifying it into a, like, new form.
Into a new form, into a readable form.",Medium"You are classifying it into a new form or a readable form.
That is why it is a classification problem",Okay,NAWhat are the different performance metric we use for measuring a model classification model?,"Sir, like, cross validation.
Cross validation, okay.
And then...
So, that's what I remember.",MediumWhat is cross validation?,"Sir, cross validation, we take this data set and we...
The data set, we divide into k subsets and we...
The divided subsets, we...
This for our model, sir.
And some of the units, with more number of data sets, we keep running it, sir.",Medium"more number of data sets, you will acquire when you do cross validation.","So, like, given data set, we will... Like, into k, not less than, into k, we will divide, sir.
Till k minus 1, we will keep running that data sets.
What is k?
Sir, k value, like... We can take that k value of our endos.
Yeah, but what is that k used for?
No idea.
No idea.",MediumHow did the course go for you?,"It was good, sir.
I think it was good",HighWhat was good?,"Hackathon, but, like, sir, we came to know new things in Hackathon.
Like, as of now, we haven't performed any... Like, before we haven't performed in Hackathon, also.
Hackathon was a new thing for us.
Like, we got to know, like, the entire endos... Like, actually, the project which we've been doing for the whole sem, it was like, we have completed it in a day, sir.
Okay.
Yes, sir.",MediumAnd they do like…,"Yes, sir",NAThank you very much,"Thank you, sir.
Un65.
Yes, sir.",NA" Okay, so please tell me which module should I ask you questions from?","Sir, regression classification, clustering",HighShall we start ?,Yes sir.,NA What is your project?,"Sir, our project is predicting the score of a football match.",High" right.So, you are using regression models.","We were using regression models, but we were getting a very high accuracy and overfitting always because of our data set.So, then we came to you to address we use the time variate models.",High"So, why do you think overfitting happens and what is overfitting?","Sir, overfitting is when there is too much noise in the dataThe testing data gives very similar or extra values compared to training dataSo, in our data set because our data was not structured properly every time we tried to generate a score, it used to give us same score line like 1 or 0, 0, 0.That is because our data is not trained properly and there is too many similarities.The similarity between the training and testing data is almost 100 percent.",High"So, how do you detect the overfitting in the model?","Sir, usually an accuracy based on what I know usually an accuracy of 95 percent or less we can tell if there is no overfitting.And an unusual value of R square can also overfitting.Like yesterday M and R square is on a V-gordon R square value of negativeSo, that indicates there was overfitting in the model.",HighOkay.Right.And what is normalization of data?,"So, normalization is when there is a presence of outliers in the data, we tend to or any large values, we tend to bring it to a normalized scale.So, this will this is a part of pre-processing.It trains the model better.So, the different methods for normalization like mean match normalization or Z-score.Mean match normalization it normalizes the value values in a particular range.Z-score always gives the value between 0 and 1.",HighHow do you reduce dimensionality?,"So, different ways are thereFirst from principal component analysis, then we can use TNSE, SNE sorry and UMAP.So, PCA we start off by normalizing the data set.Then we calculate the covariance and we create the covariance matrix.Then from that covariance matrix we find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.So, the eigenvalues are basically the high variations that we select for feature selection.And the eigenvectors will give us the direction.So, finally, when we build this matrix, we can reduce it.",HighHow can you reduce it?,"So, we select the features which has high variance with the target feature.",HighIt is to the target feature or it is to itself.,Target feature.,NASure.,Yes.,NAOkay.That is how PCA works.Can you tell me one scenario where PCA will fail.It won't generate anything out of PCA analysis for you.,"So, in the case of sparse matrix, why..So, sparse matrix and if the matrix has zero values, still it will not generate anything out.",MediumZero values then," it is ill generate a weird output,",Low"it will not be very from the zero values.Zero values if the matrix is zero, then whatever number of points are coinciding with the origin.",  Yes sir.,NA"So, there is no distribution at all.Obviously, you can't do anything with it.", Yes sir.,NA"Now, we are not talking of a zero matrix.We are talking of a valid matrix.But yet, you can't do anything with PCA.So, what is the first thing you say, what how you generate principal components?","First thing we normalize, now that is fine.Then we calculate the variances and covariances for each and we create the covariance matrix.",HighThen you determine the principal components.,Yes sir.,NAHow?,"The eigenvalues are the principal components.A principal components.So, based on the high variance.",MediumHigh variance.,Yes sir,NA"So, that means there is a variance change happening from one.",Yes sir.,NAOne dimension to another.,"Yes sir.And based on the highest variance, we select the features for reduced dimension.And one dimension.",High"This  information is absolutely right.Now, using what you said, can you tell me where it will fit?","So, when the data is very similar, when there is no variance at all.",High"If there is no variance, then you can't do anything.",I mean just very little variance such that we cannot differentiate.,High"On that direction, it is the right direction.But little more than that.",I am not sure.,NAOkay.How did the course go for you?,"So, very well.",NAWhat gone well?,"Well.So, honestly, I learnt a lot.Being honest, unlike other courses, it was just preparing for exams or just getting marks.But here we actually applied everything.And I can tell I have a pretty good set of information with this.So, I can work on this in practical scenarios.",HighAny feedback for me?,"Everything was perfect.So, for me, this was the best course in the semester.So, I really enjoyed it.",HighThank you very much.,"Thank you, sir.",NA140 roll number.,Yes sir,NAwhat is your project ,separation of question and Answers statemnts for viva ,lowWhat kind of learning algorithms have you used?,Learning algorithms,NA"You are studying machine learning, right?",Yes sir,NAWhat are different kinds of machine learning algorithms existing?,"Classifiers, repression",NASo which one you used?,Classifiers,NAWhy?,"Sir, we used, we transcripted data and labeled them as question and statement.
We got three classes and classification will be helpful for finding each class.",highSo how did you know that classifier is the right algorithm to use for this?,"This is supervised data.
We already have a target to get a question or like separation between question and statement.
We already know the labels so we label them and we use classifiers.",highWhat different classifiers did you use?,"We used seven classifiers, sir.
Support vector, random forest dictionary, execute, gradient boost, K and N.",MediumYou will get quite a lot of classifiers,Yes sir,NAWhat is your input data like?,Input data is text and data is converted into embedding and that data was used to train,HighWhy did you convert them using embedding?,"By knowing the frequency or anything and minimizing the attributes, it's easy to classify.
It's easy to use them as attributes and classifiers that are so we use embedding techniques",High"Suppose you don't do embedding, what will happen?","So like there will be many words and wait as will be so random and the model cannot.
predict the class which we want to predict",HighSo embedding has to do that.,Yes sir,NAYou use K and N classifier?,Yes sir.,NAWhat is K?,"K nearest neighbor classifier.
It's a hyper parameter which we choose to measure the distance from how many top things we should consider to classify that into the category.",High"But what is K?
Does it mean anything?",I don't know.,NAHow do you find what is K?,Elbow points,NAElbow points,"That's for clustering sirUsually by hyper parameter tuning, where training and testing data, we don't separate too much.
We consider that point as that case best to carry",MediumWhat is cross validation?,Cross validation is dividing the data into parts and testing the model on every part so that we know that data is not grouped together in some classes and model works fine for everything,High"Right.
So once you have trained a classifier, how do you find out how good the classifier is going?","Classifiers we use F1 score accuracy, precision, accuracy precision and F1 scoreness.
In our project we consider F1 score and precision, like show the result with F1 score.",HighWhy did you choose F1 score in F1?,"It's unbiased data like each classifier may not be the same.
So F1 score will help us to know accuracy perfectly other than just finding the taught accuracy",High"Sorry I didn't understand.
Can you explain that one?","Like three classifiers sir.
Three classes sir.
Each is not same like one is 100.
Second is 200.
Some others will be 500 or something.
Finding F1 accuracy won't give a proper result but finding this F1 score will give some better idea on how well the model is performed.",MediumSo why do you think accuracy will not give a proper result?,"That's what it is.
Like the numbers may not match.",High"I didn't understand.
Can you explain with an example?","Sir, class A has 100.
Class B has 200 correct things.
Class C has 500.
But the accuracy will end up high.
But the class A and B are getting low things.
Out of 500, this got 500.
Out of 500, 100.
By finding F1 score, we will get a proper idea like for overall thing and we can evaluate the model.",Medium"So that is why F1 score.
Okay.
Did you find any situation where accuracy and F1 score are widely vary?","As of now, we did not say.
But there are some cases like when we are matching two algorithms like comparing two models for one accuracy is high.
For other F1 score, macro F1 score is high.
Like one case that do not too much but like two to three percent",High"Okay.
What is the dimension of each of your feature vectors?","Without dimensionality reduction, it is around 736 to 2000",HighSo how did this high dimension affect the earth's bottom?,"Like while training, after applying LIME, we came to know that every embedding is trying to affect so much like effect on the training process.
But after dimensionality reduction, we got some better results compared to..",HighWhy do you think dimensionality reduction helps you get better results?,"Sir, unwanted words are less frequently used words are getting like some weight or something while training the data.
By reducing the dimension and not considering those embedding, it helps us.
Okay.",MediumAnd any of your classifier is a linear classifier?,"No sir.
SVM SVM ",Low"SVM is a linear classifier.
Is SVM used for two class problem or multi class problem?","Normally it is used for two class but one versus many one versus one part made to classifier.
Very good.",High"Very good.
You have any questions for me?","Sir, I really about the paper",MediumSorry,I said to come and meet about paper,Medium"Then you can meet later on that.
You are paper is ready?","Yes sir, like you said I did not understand something.",High"So you can maybe come during lunch hour.
So you have a time I have given up to one time around twenty.
I think the next two sets of my while will start at one o'clock.
Okay.
So I have around twenty minutes break during that time.
You can meet me at that time.
Okay.
And if it bad for me?","No sir, it is great class.",LowHow did the course go for you?,Yes sir.,NA"The course was good.
What was good about the course?","Like I can well understand much deeper into this before I tried studying but I did not get all concept.
I have some clear idea about it.",HighSo the course helped you to clarify some of the concepts.,"Immediately understand many concepts.
You could understand something.",High Is there any specific area where I should ask questions from?,"The class.
Classific, sir.",Low,,What is your project?,"Sir, our project is assessing confidence for the spoken answers.
Confidence for spoken answers.
Only confidence.",Medium,,Why do you say that it is a classification problem?,"Sir, we can also perform the regressions.
You can also perform regressions.
That's not relevant.",Medium,,"Then why did you do it classification?
What is the difference between classification and regressions?","Sir, in classification, we try to fit it in a class or a classifier so that it must be within that range.
It's just pretty.
For example, by passing or failing a subject, it cannot be neither possible.",High,,Is that a supervised learning mechanism or unsupervised?,Supervised.,NA,,"Why do you say it is supervised?
Or when do you say an algorithm to be supervised learning?",When it comes under classification regressions.,High,,Why is that classification problem called as a supervised learning?,"Because for every input variable, we have some output variables or for X.
Every 5, every 5, we have X.
So that it comes under.
What does that output do for you?
For every X, you have Y.",Medium,,What does that output do for you?,"For every X, you have Y",HighWhat does the Y do for you?,It is a target.,Medium"Okay, there is a target.
So what?
How does it help you?","Based on that parameters, we can predict, whether it is...",MediumWhat is the difference between parameters and hyperparameters?,"In case the hyperparameters are based on that, for example, there are two groups.
Some of the...
Some of their one group is containing the hostlets.
Some of the group is desk colors.
Based on that, if they ask a person which is…Which class he belongs to.
If based on the hyperparameter K is equal to 3, the nearest distance for the 3, which is according to that, we will tell whether the person belongs to a desk color on the hostlets.",Medium"But why... What is parameter here?
You explained how KNL works.
But I still didn't get an answer of what is the difference between... Or what are the differences between...",K equal to 3 is a hyperparameter,HighWhat is the parameter here?,Based colors are proportional,HighOutput level is a parameter.,Yes.,NAHow do you measure the performance of a classifier?,"Based... Based on the accuracy of the matrix.
Accuracy.",MediumWhat is accuracy?,"It is...
I mean...
So, the…",LowWhat is FN and what is FP?,True post and false net.,Low"That is the expansion of it.
What are they?","How much actually it is predicting it is...
True post and so on.False net is... How much it is predicting wrongly?",Mediumwhat is fals? holidays,"Yes, very correct one.
How much negative let it spread?
How much negative let it spread?
It's wrong.",Medium"How did the course move for you?
What was the result?
What went well?","Initially I was really full focused and also gradually it decreased.I don't know why.
At the ending part a little bit I was struggling.",MediumWhat did you laugh?,Yes.,NA"What did your friends tell?I'm asking difficult questions.
No, Sadeer.","They like it was okay.
He was murdered.",LowMurdered?,Yeah.,NAThen why are you tense?,"
I'm still.
Yeah.",NAWhat is your problem?,"Sir, our project is segmentation free, character recognition based on DCT features.
Right.",Highwhat kind of problem that is?,"It is based on classification problems.Yeah, it's a classification problem and our main goal is to learn from line images.
We are trying to recognize the characters from them.
So, we are giving the input as the, we are taking the features of the images.
We are passing it to the model to train it.
And from that, we are trying to recognize the characters from the images.",High is this a supervised learning problem or unsupervised?,It's a supervised.,Mediumwhy?,"Because the, the number of, because we have a definite outcome, like we know how, we know that it is classification, like we definite, we can, it's properly classified.
The number of states unknown.
We have something called number of characters.
So, that is definite, it is properly known.
So, that's why it's supervised learning.
If it is not known, it becomes unsupervised.",Medium"Suppose I am trying to predict rainfall in Bangalore on a daily basis.
Would that be a supervised learning or unsupervised?","So, that, that falls into, it can fall into any range.
So, it will be unsupervised.",Medium"Is there any other kind of, okay, now fine, let's leave it.
So, you have a classification problem that is a supervised learning.","Yeah.
Right.",NA"
How do you measure the model?
What are the different performance metric you can employ to measure the performance of a classification?","For classification, use accuracy, accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
Accuracy, precision, recall F1 score.",Medium"
Why we have so many measures?","
Because we want to know how the data varies with different metrics.
How much error is there or how much?
Like for each, suppose there are, we have different class of data like positive and negative.
So, we want to know how each of them is, how there is, where, how there is an error in each classification?
How much error is there in each classification?
Whether it is rightly predicted or wrongly predicted.",High"So, you have built a model?","Yeah, we have built it.",High"After building the model, you test it.","And during testing, you will capture these performance metric values.
Yes.",NA"
The precision is 98%.
Okay.
The recall is 2%.
What does it tell about the model?","If the precision is 98, it tells that it is, if it predicts a character, it is predicting very close to the actual character.
Right.
And so, because the precision is high, so 98% means it is very close to the actual value.
And if recall means it is, recall is, if we have like a positive and negative class, it is 2% of the time it is predicting the positive class problem.",High"So, you have a digit classification problem?
Digital class is okay.
01234 going up to me.One number comes, you have to tell what is that number?","Sir, in this there is, there is no positive and negative.
It is only one, there is no positive and negative.
Right.",Medium then how will you calculate the precision and recall?,that can't be calculated also.,High"
In a multi-class scenario, what is false positive?
And what is true positive?","
False positive is when a positive class is wrongly predicted.",High"So, give that example with respect to the digit classification problem.
Explain it with an example.","
In our project, if a character is there, if the first character is...
It's spread to a wrongly, it becomes false positive.
The first character is predicted only.
It becomes false positive.",HighWhat is true positive?,"
True positive, if it is correct, it becomes true positive.",HighThen what is false negative?,"So, when the model is false, no, it is... How do you convert categorical data to numeric?
",MediumHow do you convert the difference between label and coding and one or ten coding?,"We can use one or ten coding or a labeling coding using…In one heart, it is only two numericals we can use.
Either it should be yes or no.
So, it becomes 1 and 0.
That is one heart.
In label and coding, we can give different labels.
Even from 0 to 9, we can label the... Of course, days of the week can be labeled from 0 to 6 like that.",High"which one should you use and why?
Which one we should use?","
So, depending on our dataset, it depends on our data set.",High"
Explain with an example.","For example, for us, we have different characters.
So, we can't use one or ten coding.
We have to use label and coding because we have to assign the states for those characters.
So, for that we are using label and coding for different states.
But if we are predicting something like if whether the character is present in that image or not, then it becomes 1 or ten coding.
If it is only 0 and 1, we should call it as binary encoding.",High"If it is only 0 and 1, we should call it as binary encoding.Why are we calling it as 1 or ten coding?",Not sure.,NA"How did you find the course?
How did you find it?","It was good, sir.
Actually, the beginning, it was very easily understandable, but later it became a little complicated, but I saw and it saw.",MediumWhat is your feedback for me?,"
Feedback for you.
So, your teaching is very clear.
It is very understandable.
It is fine, it is good.",HighHow can I improve myself?,"Sir, only the voice is in it.",High" So, where should I ask you questions from?",Chemines maybe?,LowCan you give an example?,"
So, chemines, as we know it, it's an unsupervised learning algorithm.
So, meaning where labels are not available and you are required to find the patterns in the data.
So, let's say we have given a couple of data points and we need to assign them to classes.
So, that time we can use chemines.should I explain how chemines works?",HighYeah,"
So, we start out by randomly choosing end points depending on the k value which is the number of clusters and then based on that using Euclidean distance, we compute the distance between all of the data points and the cluster points.
So, then we assign the data points to the cluster with which it has the minimum distance and then this is iteration number 1.
At the end of each iteration, we compute the next cluster center by as the mean of all the data points in a given cluster.
So, that way you keep on iterating until there is no variations in the data.
So, that's chemines.
So, talking about the problems involved in chemines, it is sensitive to outliers and then the other thing is it is sensitive to outliers.
So, another way of mitigating this would be to employ something like k median or chemines plus plus algorithms in all.
So, in k median means instead of using the mean, it will use median which is not so sensitive to outliers.
And then it does not work well with nominal data and yes sir.",HighHow do you use it for chemines?,"Normal data using it for chemines.
So, maybe we can use encoding strategy like TFIDF and then we can encode the data and then using the vectors we can compute the chemines.",HighHow do you use TFIDF?,"I think it is sir.
Sir, what is the data set involved?",High"No, we will not.",Like could you give an example?,HighTell me what is nominal data?,"Sir, like in quality data you have nominal and ordinal.
So, ordinal means they can be ordered like a grid, like O grid and all.
Nominal is any other string data.
So, in that sense, yeah it cannot be employed here.
K means cannot be employed in that scenario.",HighThe question is can you use TFIDF?,"TFIDF.
Sir, but let's say you are given a corpus of documents and then in each document based on the bag of words you are computing the TFIDF in that case it works.",High"Then that is not data, that is unstructured data.","Oh yeah, yes sir.
Correct, yes sir.
Yes, that is nominal data.
Yes sir, correct.",Low"
So, what do you do with the nominal data?","Sir, maybe we can employ maybe one naught encoding and based on that we can do it.",Medium"So, what happens is one naught encoding?","In one naught encoding like you create a vector with equal to a number of dimensions as a number of unique categories.
And then if this particular category is present then only that value will be a high value which is 1.
I just allow it to be 0.
Oh yeah, again over there that issue comes.
Yes sir.
All of them will have the same distance and it wouldn't proceed further.
Oh, I am not sure sir.",MediumHow do you find out what is the value of K?,"
A value of K you have three methods maybe you can use the empirical method like root of N by 2.
Or you can use cross-validation method or you can use the elbow graph.",HighWhat is root of N by 2?,"A root of N is the total number of data points.
So, root of N by 2 will give you like rough estimate of which the K value which you should use.",HighWhat is the problem if you use the approach of root of N by 2?,"It may not hold true in all cases like.
So, that is just like a general measure and it won't hold true in all cases.
That is why we should use cross-validation where we split it into training, testing and validation.",HighWhat do you mean by cross-validation?,"In cross-validation like we specify like let's say the size of the dataset is M. So, till M minus 1 will take the dataset, we will split it into three partitions like train, test and validation.
So, training, training dataset will be used to train the model and validation dataset will be used in the, I mean the test dataset will be used after like the model is trained to test its accuracy and all.
And then we will try various values of K with the validation dataset and the model and whichever produces the best result that K value will be used.",HighWhat is the impact of normalization on K mean salgur?,"Impact of normalization on K means algorithm.
So, normalization is generally used to scale the data and manage the presence of outliers.
So, under normalization we have various strategies like z-score, min-max, decimal scaling etc.
So, by doing this given that K means is sensitive to outliers, we can solve that issue by using normalization.",HighHow will outliers effect will you get reduced by normalization?,"Like considering z-score normalization in that it tells you the number of divisions by which a given data point is of the standard deviation.
So, by identifying that we can normalize the data and that way it will fall within a given range.
It won't be outlier.
Like all the data points will be normalized to a given range.",High"So, you are saying if you do z-score normalization in outlier doesn't remain outlier anymore?","No, z-score normalization allows you to detect the presence of outliers.
Then you need to manage it.
That only tells you the number of divisions by which a given data point is away from the standard deviation.
So, usually we take the z-score value if it is greater than 3 we consider to be an outlier.
So, that way we can detect it as an outlier and then just apply any of the other strategies to just maybe replace it with null zero value or a given range.
So, replace it with the median in case of outliers.",HighDoes dimensionality of the feature vectors affect the performance of camins?,"Dimensionality.
Yes, of course, dimensionality will affect because in camins will normally use Euclidean descents.
And in Euclidean descents as a number of features that is the dimensions increases.
That way, a number of computations you would need to do.
So, that would become computationally intensive task so that affects the performance.",High"So, what will you do if you have items or vectors?","Logist, you know logistic.
Glass of regression which allows you to like do feature selection by reducing certain features is zero.
So, it tells you to manage that.",High"So, you will reduce dimensionality.","
No, it is not dimensionality reductions rather selection, feature selection, it tells you which features is select.",HighHow did the course go for you?,"Sir, I actually like the way you ended the course.
It was like it made us think about the solutions which are currently there and their limitations.
How we can, we taught that they are the best implementations which are possible with the current technological innovations.
But there are still a lot more things you can do with it to improve its like technology can be seen under two facets like the ethical use and non-ethical use.
So, we need to look into ways on how by which we can improve on the ethical use and reduce on the non-ethical use.",HighFeedback?,"No sir, it was interesting like every now and then when you felt that the class was distracted, you brought in examples and that rekindled our attention.",HighWhat is your project?,"We are operating by trispecter index value using a lesson.
We have to measure the depth of anesthesia in search of it.",HighSo what kind of problem is it?,It's regression problems.,MediumWhy do you say it is a regression problem?,"We have to determine continuous values.
The environment is basically a continuous value.
We have to determine a point in that.
It's a regression problem.",High"Okay.
Is your regression a supervised learning problem or unsupervised?",Regression is supervised.,MediumWhy?,"Regression you are actually estimating continuous values.
It's not labeled so much but it's unsupervised.
It's unsupervised.",Medium"Okay.
How do you measure the regression model?","I mean evaluate its metrics.
We can use a MAP, RMC root mean square error and mean absolute error.
And even r square.",HighWhat is the range of output values for MAP?,MAP 0 to 100.,NAIs it possible that MAP will give you values which is outside this range?,"In case of maximum error.
No, I don't think so.
Okay.
Yeah, it might give a little bit of a chance of error.
In case there is too much error.",MediumYou don't have to give negative values.,"Mean absolute.
Absolute so no.
No.
I can't give a negative.
There's a modulus functioning the formula",Medium"Good.
Now suppose you are getting a MAP value which is very very large like infinite.
What could be the reason?","It could be the fact that the predicted value was way off.
And again if it's positive it's not a positive infinite.
So the predicted value was way off.
So there was a mistake in the regression calculation itself on the model side.
So therefore the value was very high.",HighIs that possible?,It's possible.,NA"You can use pen and paper if you want to clean mix.
Organize your thoughts or put down some example.","It's the order of the way of server.
Yeah, it's unlikely that it will be way too large.",HighAny other situation?,"The predicted value, the actual value is a very small number.
But then if the model messed up and gave a very large number, when they say the predicted value was like in some minute decimals and the predicted value was way too large.
Then knowing math, the value will be increased and then multiplied by 100.
That's going to increase the value by 24",High"That's good.
So what is the effect of normalization on regression?","The effect of normalization would bring values, like how can I use values which are way too high and dimension, that might mess up the calculation of parameters like beta, not beta ones, values.
They might mess up with the other values, the other parameter values are going in small.
This one value is big.
It might throw the computation off.
When you bring it down, normalize it through min-max or preferably z, it won't throw the math off much.
It won't deviate too much, it won't affect the calculation too much.
The predicted value can land closer to the actual value.",MediumWhat is the effect of dimensionality?,"As I understand it, if you have too much high dimensional data, the model will have to consider all of that.
That's a lot of computation that goes behind.
Too many dimensions can also introduce noise into the training, which again affect the quality of the model.
So also the sub-question could say, hey, I think I'll answer one part.
Another thing is, there is too many dimensions, but not enough data again to back those up.
That's another problem over there.",Highwhat is overfitting?,"Overfitting is when the model fails to generalize whatever it's trying to predict.
Then it learns the noise and the training data too well.
Under the performance on the actual test data, for example, if we have a curve over here and points like this, it fits too close to the point over here.
So it's forward-fit over there.",HighWhy should it be overfitting?,"It's learnt all the noise.
It's snapped fit to all the training data",HighSo what should you do in that scenario?,"What we do in that scenario, in different models, take different ways to solve the overfitting problem.
For example, in K&N, we find a perfect value of K. In decision trees, integration, whatever we prune it.
So that it doesn't overfit to the data.
And in neural networks, again, if there's an overfitting thing, we drop neurons.
Yeah, drop neurons are ensemble learning.
We bootstrap.
We use it random forest regressures.
So that again, it prevents overfitting over there.",High"Final question.
You have so many different ways overfitting can be avoided by different models",Yeah,NA"Can you see through to find out what is happening?
How overfitting is getting avoided?
For example, when you prune a decision tree, what are we doing?","So if we're cutting off nodes or leaves, that would have... No,",Medium"that is fine.
But what is the underlying principle?
Why it is avoiding overfitting?
Yes, similarly, try to look from both sides.
Suppose you are increasing the value of K overfitting is avoided.
What are we doing there?
There is underlying principle which is matching them.
Whether increasing the value of K or reducing the number of levels.
Okay.
So what are we trying to do?
They are not different things.","Increasing generalization, the ability of the model",High"Yes, but that is what is avoiding overfitting.
But how are you avoiding overfitting by these techniques?",We are preventing the model from learning too much noise,High" when you are increasing K, what is happening?","When we are increasing K in the controlled manner, we are allowing it to consider more neighbors or it generalizes more.
It learns more patterns.
It doesn't become too specific to certain patterns.",HighSo number of observations are increasing.,Yes,NA"Given the same dimensionality.
When you are pruning in this century, what I will do?","So pruning in decision tree, we are reducing it from taking in too many features into consideration",High"So dimensionality is reduced, keeping in the number of observations.
So what are we taking?",We are taking control of dimensionality.,HighSo is it only dimensionality?,"Dimensionality here.
As for my understanding, so far only dimensionality.
Keep only thinking that it is only dimensionality.",HighBut dimensionality was not there in K,"Yeah, dimensionality was not much of a...
He did this a bit of a entrance in K. But...
Almost on the access of…",Low"It's okay.
Go and think over it.
Okay?
We will see there is a relationship existing.
Okay.
And that is the fundamental relationship, which is therefore over a wedding overfitting.
And then when you try to extend it across all models, you will see exactly the same thing we are doing everywhere.
We might be doing it in different ways.
But the core principle you have answered is...","It's a core principle, a core principle, a component analysis.",Medium"No, principle component analysis is also doing the same thing.
Okay, but what is that thing?
Okay.
Anyway, how did the course go for you?","Sir, I found it interesting.
Personally, as knowing my weaknesses as a learner, I need a bit more illustrations.
Illustrations and animations to properly...
Which properly visualise and nail the complex math.
But it was good.
The theory part held up for me.
That could have been the...
I just want to finally firmly fit it in.",MediumAny feedback for me?,"Like I said, me personally out of preferred animations, but your explanation is very well.
It's really good.
I think some people who might need a little bit more drilling in of the concepts to visualise and learn and fitting in all that, it took me like a really good chunk to understand, what properly underfitting and overfitting meant.
I needed to look at a lot of visualisations.
So that could help.",HighThank you very much.,"So, is there any way I can know how much it works?",Highwhat are u prepared for the viva.,Linear regression and clustering.,HighYou have prepared KN and classification linear regression and clustering.Okay.What are the parameters for linear regression?,Parameters.,NAYes.,K means clustering.,LowLinear regression.,MSC RMSC.Means square root means square.,HighAre there parameters or performance matrix?,Performance matrix.,Low"Performance matrix.All right.So, what is the equation for linear regression?",y equal to M expression?,LowOkay.What are M and C's?,C constant.,LowC is a constant.What does it do?Is M a variable or a constant?,M is a variable.,LowThen what is X?,Intercept.,Low"Okay.Fine.So, Y equal to M x plus C and M is intercept.And C is a constant.So, when you combine this intercept M and the constant C, what do they do for the equation?",To predict the predict.,Medium"predict Y from X.Okay.So, let us say you have found the values of M and C and you have a data set.How will you measure how good your evaluation of M and C are?",Performance matrix.,LowPerformance matrix.Very good.What performance matrix can you use in this scenario?,To find the mean square or root square?,HighM a p.

",Yes sir.,NA"And in decision tree?
","In decision tree.
",NA"How do you construct a decision tree?
That is basically how does the training happen for a decision tree?
","Yes sir.

What is the equation of a perceptron?
",Perceptron?,NA"How do you measure the performance of a classifier?
","Measure the performance of a classifier.
",NA"Yes.
","KNN classifiers sir... We will find the distance from each and every point.
In KNN classifiers, we will find the distance from each and every point, Sir, in data points, 
",High"Each and every point to what?
","The given value.
Like, they will assign a k value like some x value sir.
We will find distance from every single value sir.
And then we will assign... We will arrange in ascending order sir.
We will take first five...
If the k value is five, we will take the first five values.
And then we will classify into those five values.
Like...
Suppose we will take a house sir, four houses are there.
Green, red, blue yellow.
If we ask which house you are staying, we will take your qualities.
We will take some of the attributes.
Like what and all you have.
Your age, your family, how many members are there?
We will take something.
Which will be connected.Something will be connected sir.
These values are there same in for this house.
Four house people, four bedroom, three bedroom, like that.
If four bedroom is yellow house, your four members are staying.
We will assign you to yellow house.
Or else three members rooms sir.
Three members house.
Your three members are there.
Something, when I attribute which is matches, we will assign you to that house.
We will classify like that.
",Medium"Okay, So how is this process affected by normalization of data?
","Normalization, sir.
",NA"Yes.
","Normalization means alphabetical values, changing alphabetical values into numerical values.
",Medium"I think you are confused with encoding.
","Normalization means, normalization means unordered data sir.
Organised data is called..
",Low"Okay.
","ordinal means, ordered data.
Nominal means unordered data.
",Medium"Correct. How did the course go for you?
","Nice sir, like you make to understand with examples sir.
We do not have any senior faculty before sir.
Most of the things you make with examples, like writing notes, giving pdfs, not like that.
You make us to understand what you know, understand that.
Listen and then understand, not like writing and all.
Like, real world examples.
Real things sir.
Very nice sir.
",Medium"Any feedback for me?
","One thing, only a bit low voice that's it sir.
Remaining all fine sir.
Like one mic you using means fine sir.
",Medium"Sure.
","Remaining all nice sir.
",NA"Thank you very much.
","Thank you, sir.
",NA"Your registration number is 272.
","272 sir.
",NA"Very good morning.
Did you have breakfast?
","Yes sir, I had.
",NA"Good.
","Did you have sir?
",NA"Yes I had.
What do you want me to ask you?
","Sir I know the topic, Confusion matrix.
",Low"Very well, anything else?
","Like more importantly I know this topic, comparatively to other topics.
",Low"Confusion matrix.
Okay fine.
So can you tell me what are the different constituent components of a Confusion matrix?
","You mean TP, TN and all that?
",NA"Yeah.
","So we have true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative.
So your true positive gives us proper positive, accurate, what is it?
And true negative gives us in that model what negative we get.
But when it comes to false positive, it predicts as a positive, but actually answer would be negative.
And when it comes to false negative, they will predict it as negative, but the actual accurate answer will be positive.
",Medium"Can you draw the structure of a Confusion matrix?
There is pen and paper in front of you.
","I don't know sir. I am not that sure.
",NA"What do you use the Confusion matrix for?
","Sir we have a model, so in that we have accurate and inaccurate data.
So to find accurate data that they will predict.
So we use Confusion matrix.
",Medium"So we use confusion matrix for predicting that.
","We find accurate and inaccurate instances we will find.
",Low"How?
","Suppose, for example, if we will have true, false, the accurate answer will be true, but we can predict that as false, like we can predict it as true, also we can predict it as false also like suppose in a table if it is dog, not dog again dog, that can be predicted as not dog, dog also not dog also.
",Low"Okay, so that is all case by case example you are giving.
For that do we need to have a Confusion matrix?
","Yes.
",NA"Why?
","Why in the sense?
",NA"What is the use of Confusion matrix for us?
","That is the thing sir, for finding inaccurate and accurate instances to find that.
",Low"Sorry?
","To find inaccurate and accurate instances we use Confusion matrix.
",Medium"To find accurate and inaccurate.
You will know by just comparing the values.
Why do you need a Confusion matrix for that?
","Sir, when you compare it you don't get the proper accuracy.
But when you use, when in Confusion matrix we have many TP, TN, FN , FP and all so when you use all that we get a proper dataset.
When we use, when you just normally compare it we do not get the proper accuracy or precision or recall we do not get that properly.
But when you actually compare with Confusion matrix we get it when you compare with TP, TN and FN, FP.
",Medium"So what do you do for a regression problem?
Do you use a Confusion matrix for a classification problem or for a regression problem?
","In that case for regression.
So can we use not exactly Confusion matrix but what do I say?
I don't know how do you use it for regression.
",Low"Sorry?
","I do not know actually properly how do you use it for regression.
",Medium"Ok, How do you use it for classification?
This is Confusion matrix you use it for classification or clustering?
","Classification.
",NA"You use it for classification.
Ok.
So for regression what do you use?
","For regression we use the classify and regression. Yes sir. 
",Low"For regression we classify and regression.
","I do not know that.
",NA"Sorry?
","I do not know about that.
",NA"Okay. Can you tell me how do we normalize data?
","By normalization?
",NA"What are the normalization techniques you know?
","Sir in normalization first we... I forgot sir.
",NA"Can you tell me what is the difference between mean and median?
","Yes sir.
",NA"Tell me.
","So, median is the middle what we get and mean is it overall?
Median is from that whole data set what is median, middle thing and mean is how we calculate by the formula.
",Medium"Okay.
That is a very interesting concept.
What do you understand by vector independence?
","No sir, vector independence I don't know.
",Low"How did the course go for you?
","It went well sir.
But the subject is actually a little bit tough.
",Medium"Subject is filled with?
","Like little bit tough but your teaching is really good.
And hackathon idea everything is really good sir.
",Medium"Okay.And any feedback for me?

","You were always, you took class properly, you came on proper time everything was from your side it was excellent.
Because of the subject was tough I could not do that great.
Then I didn't do a good job right?
Sir you did a great job because of my capacity I could not do that much better and in ML subject.
",Medium"No problem.
I understand.
That's fine.
Thank you.
","Okay sir.
Thank you.",NA" Right, so what have you prepared, please close the door.
","Sir clustering.
",NA"You have prepared clustering.
Okay.
What clustering have you studied?
","Sir in general like what clustering is , what it does.
",Medium"Okay.
Tell me what it does.
","Sir clustering is unsupervised learning based machine-learning model and basically it unlabled data it tries to group it together to find patterns so that it can put it into a cluster.
",Medium"But why should I put it into a cluster? That is the question.
","Sir if there are any patterns that are matching that can be grouped into one cluster?
",Medium"Yeah, but why you have to form clusters is my question?
What is the need?
What purpose does it solve to put them into clusters?
","So that you can train the data based on different clusters?
",MediumTrain.,Yeah.,NA"What train you will do based on clusters?
Can you be a little more specific and explain it better?
","If you have a machine learning model, you want to train it on some clusters to get different values by taking different different clusters.
That's why you segregate them.
Because every cluster will have different values.
",Medium"Every cluster will have different values, correct.
But would I train for in a ML model using your clusters?
","Sir that depends on the what you want.
",Low"That's why I am asking , give some example scenario and explain na?
","Sir in real life?
",NA"Yes.
","I mean in real life, what I can think of is if you want to segregate your laundry, based on different cloth material or color, you can segregate them.
",Medium"Okay.
So that is how clustering you will do?
",Yeah.,NA"Okay.
So you will put clothes in different colors or lenin type or whatever right?
Once that is done, what will you do with it?
","That depends on 
",NA"What else are you going to train.
","Sir if I want to wash clothes based on if it's a linen and cotton and wool maybe I need to do laundry, I can't put in washing machine.
So that's specific set of clothes we will go in.
",Medium"Let's go with your example of laundry.
","Yes.
",NA"So how will you do the clustering?
","Based on cloth type.
",NA"Based on cloth type?
","Yes.
",NA"How will you put it into your ML framework?
I mean, cloth types is a concept.
Yeah.
Right?
And cloth type, how will you capture that?
","What type may not be, I mean maybe color, maybe even colors we can segregate it.
If you want to build your ML model.
",Low"And what would be your color values?
","Sir we will assign it.
So like if red is zero, we will keep aside and green is one.
Blue is like label encoding we can do.
",Low"Then is it a clustering problem or it's a classification problem?
","That will come under classification.
I mean, you can assign values and based on that only you can do clustering.
",Medium"Which values?
","Uh.
We can do mean shift.
Means shift clustering.
So like if there are a bunch of clothes and then I mean, means shift basically like there's a number of data points and then based on each mean you assign that cluster to that.
That the one in the middle assigned to that cluster will belong to which cluster.
We can do it that way.
",Medium"How do you find out how many clusters are to be formed in that dataset?
","Um.
K means clustering.
Sir like there are like now K is like number of clusters that are being formed and based on that performance metrics we'll figure out which one to use.
",Medium"Which performance metric will you use?
","Silhouette score, DB index, CH index.
",NA"Using silhouette score how will you find out how many clusters are to be formed?
","Silhouette score like once you put all the clusters in the silhouette score the ones with the highest silhouette score you will choose that.
That's the most optimal one.
",Medium"Highest silhouette score is the optimal one.
","Yeah.
",NA"After that it will reduce.
","Uh.
Yeah.
May go up or down.
But the one which is like if all in all the one which is the highest one that one we will choose.
",Low"Okay.
So now let's say you have data like column of that one.
How will you use it for clustering?
","Um.
I don't know sir like.
We can use embedding,
Um, like in our project when we have like text data we use embedding and then based on that.
Uh, we used k mean and mean shift.
So based on that.
Like again, like we had like formed like 10 clusters suppose.
So if the 10 clusters like again we use perform metrics.
Like similar like clothing, we can do.
",High"Yeah, but you have values like red, blue, green.
","Even even in ours we have values like.
Uh, we have a math question.
Suppose there is a question in the student is answering.
I don't know or I didn't answer correctly.
",Medium"So how do you do that?
You will directly use it for clustering?
","No, so you can.
Convert.
Convert it to T5 and BERT.
Like we did that and then based on that.
Uh, we say like we fall we got like.
Suppose we got 10 clusters.
We have so based on that we did for used the performance metrics.
What we found was that.
The clusters are formed based on the questions that are asked.
Not the answers of the students.
Like that.
So like clothing again, like we can use embedding and then we can figure out.
",Medium"Which embedding would you use?
","We used T5 and BERT.
Um, either of those.
",NA"Just for putting color names you will use T5 and BERT.
","One method you asked what to use.
So.
",Low"Okay.
T5 or BERT.
What is the dimensionality of vector they generate?
","No, I don't know sir.
",NA"You have done it in your project and you don't know.
","I am not sure sir.
",NA"Okay.
I will remember that for your project presentation.
","No sir.
",NA"Okay.
Good.
You have heard of what is called encoding?
","Uh, one hot and.
Yes sir.
",NA"What encoding say you heard of?
","One hot, label.
",NA"What are they?
","So one hot is like basically can divide your values into zero or one or true or false.
Based on that.
Uh, and so suppose if, um, if there are a number of week days, so each day if you have done upward particular work, it is yes on Monday.
So it is one.
It is not on tuesday it's zero like that.
Label is for each.
Suppose each day of the week, you will be like Monday zero, Tuesdays one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
It goes like that.
Each, each, uh, value you are assigning a label.SO,you have one or two or three.
",Medium"So when you do one hot encoding, what happens to the dimensionality of the data?","I mean, there are many, I think it reduces dimensionality.
Noise is less.
",Medium"Dimensionality reduces.
Okay. What is cosine similarity?
","So, um, I do not know how to explain the curve.
You have a graph.
",NA"I have a graph Okay.
","If the graph is in 90 degrees then it is orthogonal in cosine similarity.
You have a formula A dot B by A cross.
",Medium"What is A dot B?
","Dot product.
",NA"Write it.What is A?
What is B?

","Two points in the graph I guess.
",NA"Two points in the graph.
Is it vectors or scalars.
","Vectors.
",NA"What is the output?
Is that a vector or a scalar?
","Uh, vector, I think scalar sir.
",NA"How does it become a scalar?
","Because of the formula, 
",NA"Which formula?
How does it make a vector into a scalar?
","Because you are using dot product, so it gives I into i becomes one unit.
",Medium"How did you like the course?
","Um, sir, it was a lot of theory.
",NA"Now you are lying?
","No, sir, it was a lot of theory.
I, um, I can't remember too much stuff.
",Medium"Any feedback for me?
","Sir volume.
That's it.
At the back of the class, we can't hear properly.
Actually.
",Low"Okay.
Makes sense.
Anything else?
","No, sir.
",NA"Thank you very much.
274?","Yes sir.
",NA"Tell me what should I ask you?
","Clustering sir.
",NA"Clustering.
It's clustering a supervised learning problem or unsupervised?
","Unsupervised sir.
",NA"Why do you say that?
","Because in supervised, you train the data on the labeled, you train the model on the labeled data.
But in unsupervised, you try to find out the patterns.
Like the model will try to find out the patterns and it will try to train on that.
",Medium"Okay.
Very good.
What are the clustering algorithms do you know?
","K-means clustering, DB scan.
",Medium"DB scan?
Can you explain the DB scan algorithm?
","No idea sir.
",NA"No.
Okay, K-means?
","So in K-means, like, what you do is like all the data points,
Like, you will take K-clustering, like initially you will give K-number of clusters are to be taken, and all the data points.
Like you will also give centroids of all the K-clusters, then you will give the data points and all those data points you will assign to the nearest centroid of the cluster.
Then depending on that, you will take the mean of all the data points in that particular cluster.
You will change the centroid again and you will try to repeat this process trying to get more compact clusters and you will try to separate the clusters.
",Medium"Okay.
Can you give an example data distribution where K-means will not work at all?
","Like in cases where there is more data, like the classes are very similar, then you won't be able to use K-means.
",Medium"So what should you do in that scenario?
",Maybe use SVN. ,NA"SVN.
","No.
",NA"Okay.
Since you talked about SVN, let's come to SVN. What is SVN?
","Sir SVN is like support vector.
Like you will try to use it in cases where like, what do you say?
Like when the classes are very close to each other, then you will take the margin points and you will try to see whether like they come into this particular classification or it will go outside of the boundaries like you take margins, you will give the boundaries and you will check if they are within or outside.
",Medium"What is margin?
","Like if it's a middle gap between two classes.
",Low"It's a gap between two classes.
Is a large gap good or bad?
","Large gap is good, you want the data to be more specific so that you can train the model well and even after you give the testing data, then it will be able to predict the classes specifically to this particular class.
If they are close to each other, then there is no point of even.
That would be the problem.
",Medium"Everyone wants large but you don't get it.
","Yes sir.
",NA"Data is what it is.
So why is a large margin desirable?
","Because you will be able to classify well.
",High"What's wrong with small margin classification?
","Then everything will..
",NA"Now you will be drawing a line.
How thick is the line?
As long as you can draw a line, it should be there.
What is the role of margin?
","It will distinguish the classes well.
Like if you take daily products, milk and paneer, they are both of the same material.
So if the model doesn't know the difference between milk and paneer, it can classify paneer as milk and paneer.
",Medium"There you can draw a line.
Right?
","Yes sir.
",NA"Forget about large margin.
There is no margin.
But you have a margin.
Between the narrow margin and large margin.
Why is large margin desirable?
","That will make things easier for us to... 
",Medium"For you?
or for the model.
","For the model to classify.
",Medium"How?
","There is an objective function for this.
",Medium"What do you mean by objective function?
","Like if you take K means clustering, we use WCSS.
You will take the data point and the centroid.
Then you will take the mean of them.
You will like iterate through all the points in the cluster.
Then you will like it through all the clusters.
And you will see whether this value is less.
If this value is less, then you will be able to classify a particular thing into a particular cluster.
And you will be able to know well that this belongs to this category.
Making it easy for us to... 
",Medium"What is it's equivalent in SVM? Classification.
","No idea sir.
",NA"No idea. Okay.
So now let's look at clustering again.
How is clustering affected by high-dimensional data?
","It will cause overfitting and it will bring noise into the scenario.
Like also in high dimensions.
The distance between the nearest point and the farthest point, it wouldn't mean anything.
Because...
Normally if you can be able to differentiate using Euclidean distance, it will be able to say that they are this distant and they are apart.
But in higher dimensions, we will have multiple x, y, z.
So even if it's low in one thing and high in one thing, it wouldn't mean anything.
",High"Why?
Distance is a distance.
Why do you say it wouldn't mean anything?
","Here we are clustering no sir in this high dimension.
So in higher dimension, if it is closer to x-axis and it's farther in...
If we take two clusters, one is closer to x, one will be closer to y.
And also in some scenarios, they can be like almost equivalent.
It will become very compute like higher.
We would need more resources to compute.
It will become very complex.
",Medium"Okay.
So how is that problem not occurring in lower dimension?
Same problem exists in lower dimension also right?
","Yes sir.
",NA"So why are you blaming high-dimension for that?
","No idea sir.
",NA"No idea.
Okay.
Suppose you have all the data values with categorical.
","Yes sir.
",NA"Can you do clustering?
","Categorical data?
",NA"And if you do clustering, what will happen?
","I don't think you will be able to do categorical for clustering because like clustering, you will take numerical value and you will try to...
Cluster the measure if you do for a particular category.
Then if you take for example, there is a supermarket, there are multiple spices and there is dry fruits.
Then...
I think you can do sir.
You can do for them also.
",Medium"So now, sometimes few seconds back, one minute back, you said no, now you are saying yes.
Which is right?
","What I said earlier.
Like the latest one.
",NA"You can?
","Yes sir, you can.
This is what I am assuming.
",NA"Good.
Very good.
How did the course go for you?
","The course it went well sir.
",NA"What went well?
","Like... Machine learning initially I thought it wasn't going to be that interesting but... Like, you teaching it made some difference.
Like...
I am not saying like...
",Medium"I don't agree but continue.
","I felt like...
I see in other courses it's like very dry so they just go through the PPts.
And you didn't bring the concept of like showing PPts and teaching us like... You went straight forward through the concept it was simple it was clear.
It was concise.
",Medium"Any feedback for me?
","Just like increase your volume, that's it sir.
",NA"Thank you very much.
275?
","Yes sir, 275 sir.
",NA," Physically I was present.
",NA"Physical you are present.
Right.
What have you prepared?
","Everything I prepared.
And no, no.
Few only I prepared.
",NA"That is what I am asking, where should I ask questions from?
","Classification.
",NA"Classification.
Tell me the name of one classifier which considers the sequentiality of events.
","KNN?
",NA"KNN?
How KNN handles sequentiality?
","No idea sir.
",NA"No idea.No.
Okay.
Do you know what is SVM?

Have you heard of what is called Markov process?
","Yes sir.
Support vector Machine.
",NA"Can you explain SVM to me?
","It is used for classification or regression concepts.
It actually takes a hyperplane to classify into different classes.
",Medium"Okay.
How many different classes can it classify?
","Whatever are there.
Like how
",NA"What are support vectors?
","The vectorized form they will take no sir, support vector machine to classify.
Whatever we have vectorized it.
Vectorized data.
",Low"What do you mean by your statement?
Maybe write down and explain the terms used in it.
","Whatever we have vectorized that data it will take into support vector machine and it categorizes into different classes.
",Medium"Okay.
So does support vector mission classify or operate on the principle of distance or operates on the principle of similarity?
","On distance.
",NA"Distance.
What distance?
","Or similarity also, sir.
",NA"Similarity also.
Sometimes similarity sometimes, distance.
Monday similarity.
Tuesday distance.
Friday similarity.
Okay.
All right.
So which distance does it use?
","Euclidean distance.
",NA"Write the formula for Euclidean distance.
In n-dimensional space.
Very good.So now please tell me.
What is that one by n doing?

","I have divided it with number of things.
",Low"Number of?
It looks good to put it there.Okay.
So this is how euclidean distance is calculated.
All right.
Where do you use this concept?

Okay.

You made some modification.
What is the modification you made?

1 by n. Then some n. sigma y minus x.
1 square.
Okay.
This is Euclidean distance right?
Okay.
So where do you use it?

","We give you some value of k and to find another something.
",LOW"Another something.
What thing?
No idea.
How do you measure the performance of a classifier?
","By F1 score, accuracy.
",NA"F1 score and accuracy?
","Accuracy and recall, precision.
",NA"F1 score, accuracy, recall precision.
You use it for measuring?
","Performance.
",NA"Performance.
All right.
What is the difference between precision and recall?
","Precision is to find the normal.
True positives and the predicted positives sir.
",Medium"True positives and predicted positives.
","Normal positives in the predicted total predicted positives.
Recall is used to find the actual positives in the whole.
",Medium"Recall is used to find?
","Actual positives.
",NA"That is for virtual positives.
","No positives in the predicted positives only that one.
",Low"Okay.
I am still confused can you explain?
","I will write sir.
",NA"Here.
What did you write?
","Precision is, we will find positives in the only positives, predicted positives.
It may be true positives or false positive also no.
",MediumOkay.,"Recall is true positive, we will find the positives in the total.
Like what are the proper positives?
True positives and false negatives also positives only no sir.
Like that.
",Medium"Okay.
Right.
How will this formula change if you are doing a multi-class problem?
","We will use F1 score.
",NA"For multi-class?
","Yes sir.
",NA"Okay.
And bi-class, the precision and recall.
How is F1 score calculated?
","Harmonic mean of this precision and recall.
",Medium"So in a multi-class scenario, how will you calculate F1 score if there is no precision recall?
","We will calculate this values no sir, precision and recall.
",Low"The precision and recall you will calculate.
Okay.
So create a 3x3 matrix.
Okay.
The rows are actual values and columns are predicted values.
Okay.
So let's say you have values like 10.
","10?
",NA2,"Actual values, 2.
",NA"1.
Then 3.
15.
Next row.
","Okay.
",NA"3, 15.
0.
And next row.
7.
21.
3.
Now can you calculate the precision?
","No idea sir.
",NA"Okay.
Is high dimensional data good or bad?
","High dimensional data it is not good.
",Medium"Why you say it is not good?
","Because if it is more dimensional, it takes so much computational time or something to happen also so.
",Medium"That is the problem.
Suppose we get a fast computer? No problem.
","Yes.
We will try to reduce it to lower dimensional means better no sir.
",Low"How?
",We can use PCA.,NA"PCA.
What is PCA?
","Component Analysis.
Principle component analysis.
",NA"How does it reduce dimensionality?
","It reduces the dimensionality from high to low without like changing the variance value.
",Medium"How?
No idea.
No problem.
So at least then you are present the class.
How do you like the course?
","It was nice sir actually.
Many classes but it was nice.
",low"What is your feedback for me?
","Actually so good sir.
Because most of the teachers like they tell through PPT's or something no.
You properly have the notes of what you want to say and you will say it neatly sir.
Real life example you have given everything.
That we like about you.
",medium"Thank you very much.
","Thank you sir.
",NA"Is that a classification problem? Regression or
","Yes sir. Classification.
",NA"Is that a supervised learning?
","Yes sir.
",NA"Why?
","Because we are working with the labeled data.
We have labeled data which we are trying to predict on the base of the labeled data.
There are three classes in that.
Four.
Four classes.
",Medium"Four classes are there.
","Yes sir.
",NA"Why do you choose classification as a problem for this scenario?
Why do you think this is a classification problem?
","Because sir on the dataset there are features and labels.
So on the basis of feature we need to predict will the case will be accepted or rejected?
Means it will fall in which category.
That is the meaning of classification.
We need to classify in which class it will go.
That is why I think it is a classification problem.
",Medium"Okay.
Why can't you use regression for this?
","We can use regression techniques but still we need to convert them.
On the basis of regression result we need to classify them into the classes.
",Medium"What is your input?
","Features.
Initially we got a data set which contained pre-processed data.
But after that we contacted you, we got a textual data and we used different embedding on that.
",Medium"Why did you use embeddings on your data?
","For getting better outputs.
Because sometimes giving directly the data input features will not perform well with the models.
So we use embedding sometimes to convert textual data to numerical values to perform well with the certain models.
",Medium"How else can you convert textual data to embedding when it is not unstructured data?
","Sir we have different techniques like one-hot encoding and embedding and one-hot encoding.
",Medium"Okay.
What is normalization of data?
","Normalization of data means if we need to scale the data values in a certain range from 0 to 1.
Getting the mean of that feature 0 and standard deviation to 1.
",Medium"So how do you decide which model to take as the final model for your classification problem?
","Based on the dataset and doing the pre-processing we can get some idea about which model can be useful for that.
After that we can do try and testing.
After using multiple models we can get the accuracy of the models.
So we can decide either we need to go for a sole model or we need to combine a normal weak learning models to get a meta model to get the output.
",High"What is the problem with accuracy as a measure?
","Normally accuracy as a measure also combines false negatives in the calculation of accuracy.
So we can also use f1 score and recall to get rid of it.
",Medium"And f1 score does not use false negatives?
","But it also take a constrain of true positive and false negative also as a consideration part.
Means we get a better idea when we check if the negative is also classified correctly and positive also classified correctly.
",Medium"How would you draw the confusion matrix for a multi-class scenario like yours?
","Sir it will be n cross n matrix.
If we have 4 classes so we need to make n cross n matrix predicting for each outcome 0,1,2,3 classes and 0,1,2,3 classes.
",Medium"And in that case what would be your false positive or false negative?
","So we need to check for each classification like we have a 0,1,2,3,2,3.
So if this one is the actual and this one is the predicted value, does the actual value and predicted values in the same cell?
That one is the true positive.
Other than that will be considered as the false positives.
",Medium"Fine, how did the course go for you?
","Good sir.
",NA"Any feedback?
",,NA So tell me what should I ask you?,"Sir I prepared somewhat for regression classification and K means clustering.
",Medium"Regression, classification and K means clustering.
Okay.
What is the difference between regression and classification?
","So regression for the particular output value, like regression predicts the range of value and classification categorizes like there are the regression uses regression function like a relationship between independent and dependent vectors and classification there are categories of value.
So it predicts the categorical value like there are certain categories in the output it categorizes and for the particular test data it predicts the particular category and wherein the case of recursion it provides the range of like particular value in a particular range like example from 0 to 100.
",Medium"Right.
So, very good.
Are they supervised learning or unsupervised?
","Sir they are supervised learning because the data is labeled the output we know like which kind of output we will be getting the output is redefined and labeled whereas in an unsupervised learning the output is unlabeled.
So we can say that these both are supervised learning.
",Medium"Okay.
Can you give me one problem situation where classification should be used and one for where regression should be used?
","Sir let us take the example of grades, grades system in our college.
So in there we are having multi grade system like O, A plus A, B and C in this way.
So in this case classification will work better because we are classifying the student marks on the basis of grades.
But in the like if we want to predict the cost of house in a particular city depending on the area or depending on the number of bedrooms and the size of the house and all the architecture.
So in that case we will be using regression.
",High"Very good.
Right.
Now let us say you have been given a set of data.
Okay.
And the target is basically to build a regression model.
What are the different stages of preparation and processing will you go through before you can actually send out the model for deployment?
","Okay.
So for the regression we particularly need a function like which kind of regression model we will be using.
First of all if we want to predict the output values like in a range.
So we will be using linear regression and if only linear regression when we are having one dependent vector independent vector.
But if we are having multiple independent vector then we will be using multi-regression.
If we want in this way like let us take example if we want to categorize the data.
So in that case we will be using logistic regression.
So first of all like selection of the model will be necessary in it.
Which kind of model will be using that depends on the kind of output we want to have.
Then afterwards like we need to check if there are any noise in the data.
The data is totally clear or not like pre-processing we need to have.
So for it we will be using mean squared error or root mean squared error to pre-process the data.
And then if there is any overfitting or underfitting condition so to resolve overfitting condition we can use ridge or lasso regression in it.
That is the thing sir.
",High"
Okay.
So you talked about overfitting.
What is overfitting and how do we detect it.
","Sir overfitting causes when variance is so much high and bias is low in that curve.
So overfitting we will be detecting like overfitting means like when the data is trained so much like it contains the noise in data also.
So detection we can say overfitting I can say like detection by using detection I can say by using mean squaree error and that thing we can I think identify which kind of overfitting is in there by calculating that value.
",Medium"Which value?
","Like mean square error implies the predicted minus actual value upon total number of values.
So through that the means square value we will be getting that means there is deviation in it.
So from there we can get the like how what is the estimate of overfitting in the whole data.
",Medium"Yeah, But how do you detect it?
","Sir if value is much larger I think value is around more than 0.5 or more than around one it is.
So I think it is more overfitted.
",Medium"What is the range of values you can get from mean squared error?
","From 0 to 1 sir.
",NA"0 to 1.
So mean square error cannot exceed 1.
","Mean squared error can exceed 1.
You can say that I am not remembering that error thing.
What mean square error is the root of it.
I am not remembering the term sir.
That another kind of error that means we are taking the mod of the values like predicted minus actual upon total number that is known as 
",Medium"Mean absolute error.
","Mean absolute error yes sir.
Mean absolute error lies from 0 to 1 and mean squared error we can say can exceed 1.
",Medium"What are the challenges of having high dimensional data.
","Sir it can cause curse of dimensionality.
",NA"What are the curses of dimensionality can you explain one?.
","Sir like let us take an example.
There can be data.
There can be condition.
That take an example if a person enjoys a particular game.
So there can be 5 dimensions in it.
Like one is today's weather, then temperature, then humidity, then atmospheric condition of that place.
So there can be some columns in it that does not affect the enjoyment of that fan.
So we can remove that thing.
So from using like it can affect the overall quality of the data.
So there can be some columns or attribute in the data that can cause that may not be used.
Like they are not effective in predicting the output value.
",High"But what has that got to do anything with dimensionality of data?
","Sir dimensionality are the number of attributes.
",Low"Correct.
So you are saying there might be issues in an attribute that can happen with low dimensionality also. Right?
","Yes sir.
",NA"High dimensionality necessarily does not include noise na.
","High dimensionality include noise sir.
You can say like there can be scenario when a data can have hundreds or thousands of attributes.
So in that case this thing we need like we need to identify which what causes the curse of dimensionality.
",High"Okay.
Now how do you think this high dimensionality affect the overfitting problem?
","Overfitting.
High dimensionality we can say like high dimensionality due to high dimensionality the model can be over trained like high dimensionality can be can contain unnecessary data that cannot be useful in predicting the value.
So it can train and it can it can occupy the computational size.
It cannot be that cost effective in the case of big data and system like when data is too much use.
",High"Okay.
Okay.
How do you find the course?
","Curse of dimensionality.
Curse we can find.
",Low"No no how did you find the ML course?
","Good sir.
Theory part was really amazing.
I enjoyed the classes and all but there is some like labs can be more like interactive.
I find this way.
Like I find I found it more difficult.
",Medium"Okay.
","It can be more like interactive.
",NA"Any feedback for me?
","You are great sir.
",NA"Thank you very much.
","Thank you sir.
",NA"So please tell me what have you prepared?
","Sir, I prepared for Naïve Bayes and decision tree.
",NA"Naïve Bayes and decision tree.
","Yes sir.
",NA"Okay.
Can you explain what are the assumptions we make for Naïve Bayes algorithm?
","For Naïve Bayes we assume that Naïve is real style.
We are assuming that features are independent.
Because if features are not independent, we need to calculate joint probability for different different features.
That is right assuming and Naïve Bayes like if you don't assume that features are independent so it may give less accurate value, less accuracy as compared to if you assume that features are independent.
",Medium"Okay.
Can you write down the equation we use for Bayesian algorithm the Naïve Bayes algorithm?
","Bayesian Algorithm.
Okay.
Sir, that.
",Low"What is the mathematical equation used to represent Naïve Bayes algorithm?
","Okay.
Sir.
",NA"Yeah.
So this is Bayes algorithm or Naïve Bayes algorithm?
","This is for Bayes algorithm.
It's , For Naïve Bayes, we are assuming because these are independent.
",Medium"Which are independent?
","Features sir like this is which we are predicting and these are the features of which we are predicting.
We are assuming it is independent.
",Medium"Independent of what?
","Independent like they are not depending in each other.
Suppose we are predicting some target values there.
So through Naïve Bayes we are assuming like they are three features are there.
And one target value is there.
So those three features are not dependent on each other.
If it's dependent so we need to calculate like we are calculating the conditional probability.
So we need to calculate for every possibilities of every features.
",Medium"Very good.
So how does it help us?
That independence assumption, how does it help us?
","Like as I told like it's time consuming.
It's also time consuming.
We need to calculate for all the features.
Suppose there is one three features are there and one target value is there.
We need to calculate the probability of target value like how much it's predicting.
Suppose we need to calculate today's hot or not.
So based on this temperature and day we are calculating.
And if we are not assuming that this is independent it provides us less accuracy.
That helps us to model to that's not for most of the data it's not easy for us.
",Medium"Okay fine.
You know what is data normalization?
","Yes sir.
",NA"Can you tell me what are normalization algorithms?
","Algorithms Z-score sir.
",Low"Yeah can you write the formula for Z-score?
","Yes sir.
So Z-score formula is equal to like original value minus mean upon a standard deviation.
It's basically we are calculating their different number of large number values.
We are especially making it so it lies under a specific range.
So it's helping like some distance algorithm like KNN.
And it's basically focusing on distance.
So it may lead to less accuracy.
So we are making it one a range.
",Medium"Does this normalization affect your Naïve Bayes algorithm?
","I think not sir.
Because it's basically dependent on probability.
So it doesn't affect.
",Medium"What about dimensionality?
Does it affect Naïve Bayes algorithm?
","Yes, dimensionality affect.
",LowHow?,"Like if large number of dimensionality is there like if a number of large number features.
So it will affect like we need to calculate for all the functions, all the features.
So sometimes because large dimensionality causes decrease in performance.
So it may lead to decrease in accuracy for Naïve Bayes.
",Medium"Okay.
So now what are the different performance metrics we can use for Naïve Bayes algorithm?
","Performance metrics.
Like we can calculate accuracy one, and for Naïve Bayes we can make, we can make a few confusion matrix.
And we can find mean square errors.
",Medium"How do we make a confusion matrix for a multi-class scenario?
","Okay.
Can I draw?
",NA"Yes.
","Sir, I am taking for... Can I draw here?
Like suppose this is predicted.
Class 1, class 2, class 3.
",Medium"So essentially what you are saying is that in a multi-class confusion matrix there won't be false negatives and there won't be true negatives.
","Yes sir.
",NA"False negatives won't be there.
","I think so.
",NA"Okay.
All right.
What is your project?
","Project we need to understand the answer strength from viva audios.
",Low"What kind of problem that is?
","This is classification problem.
",NA"Why?
","Because we had made strength.
We need to find a strength.
So we had categorized in high-low medium.
So we have categorical value.
We need to classify that this is a high strength is there, low strength is there.
That's why we use classification.
And then our classification model predict most accurate values sir.
",Medium"Very good.
What is your feedback on the course and me?
","Every theory is good sir, in practical.
In lab there may be some improvement like..
",Medium"How?
","Like we go to the lab.
Everyone are doing, if you are given lab, you are just lab task for everyday.
So there may be one or two guys will be there.
So they will continuously monitoring are they are doing or not.
Because sometimes I have asked sometimes, like I don't know about this.
So that they may also tell do this.
But most of them we are using Google and doing this.
So we need to focus and learn.
I know that machine learning is there.
No one can't remember the different syntax are there.
We are importing.
So in lab part.
",Medium"Okay.
Thank you.
","Thank you sir.
",NA"Two eighty three.
","Yes sir.
",NA" Okay, Vivek.
Tell me what you have prepared.
Where should I ask you questions from?
","Sir, decision tree and KNN.
",NA"Decision tree and KNN.
Okay, you please explain how you constructed decision tree.
","Sir, for all the different attributes, first we do, what we do is calculate the entropy for the whole data.
By taking the final, what is the output like?
Yes or no or true or false
That is the final attribute that is the outcome.
We calculate the entropy for that and then we calculate, we take any one attribute and then if we divide all the different, whatever the classes are there.
We divide and calculate entropy for individual and then we calculate the information gain.
Entropy of full data minus entropy for individual and then we do the same for all the different attributes.
And whichever has the highest information gain, that becomes a root node and then similarly we will do it in sequentially sir.
",Medium"Okay, anyhow write the formula for entropy.
","Yes sir, K of I is like how many times that particular class is occurring by total like, it will be like 5 by 14 or something.
If 14 is a total number of different tools.
",Medium"Okay, and why do you have a negative sign at the beginning?
","So, entropy is like the impurity in the data set.
",Medium"Right.
But what does the negative sign do?
Adds impurity is it?
","No, actually we calculate.
I can't recall sir.
",Low"Okay. So, you calculate entropy.
Then what do you do?
","Sir, like first we calculate the entropy for the whole data based on the outcome, whatever column, I mean column is there.
And then we calculate , like there are four different columns, A, B and outcome, two columns and then one outcome.
We calculate entropy for this and then like there are, say, AA, BB, then we calculate entropy for this two and then calculate information gain for this.
And then we do the same for this also and whichever has more information gain between these two that becomes a root node.
",Medium"Very good.
You know what is data normalization?
","Yes, normalization, it is to confine the data between any two, like min and max values we define and then we confining between that two.
There are Z-score normalization and min max normalization.
",Medium"Very good.
So, another question I have is, how does normalization of data affect your information gain calculation?
","I can't remember sir.
",NA"U can't remember?
","Yes sir.
",NA"Okay.
So, let us say you have constructed your tree.
","Yes sir.
",NA"Okay.
Now, you want to measure whether this tree is good or bad.
How will you measure?
","It should not have overfitting like more number of, it should not go to depth of 20 or something.
And then, 
","It should not go to?
","More depth, sir.
",NA"What is depth?
","Like levels, level 1, 2 and all.
",Low"But how will you see that is what you are telling which is a concept right?
","Yes sir.
",NA"How will the machine know whether it has gone to depth or not?
Will it know?
","No sir.
If it gives accurate result, then it is correct.
Like the test data and data from outside.
It is the tree has been made correctly.
It is accurate.
",Medium"Okay.
That sounds strange.
What is accuracy?
","Sir accuracy is based on the conditions that we use to see whether it goes to left side or right side, true or false.
When it finally comes to an outcome, it should actually match the outcome that it was supposed to answer.
Then we can see that it is giving correct answer.
",MediumSorry?,"Sir, like if we check for condition and then based on that we go to left side or right side, true side or false side.
And then when it finally comes to leaf node falling at specific path, it should give the desired output to what was the actual output is that tree should also give that particular output.
",Medium"Okay.
So the question is how will you measure it?
","I don't know sir.
",NA"You don't know.
Okay.
Fine.
How do you reduce dimensionality?
","No idea sir.
",NA"Okay, How did the course go for you?
","Nice sir.
",NA"Okay.
Any feedback for me?
","Actually, it was okay, sir.
I couldn't understand it.
That is my issue.
I could understand, but how we actually use it, that I couldn't understand it.
In real life.
",Medium"So why did you not approach me and try to understand that?Thank you very much.

","Thank you sir.
",NA"284, right?
","Yes sir.
",NASo tell me what should I ask you?,"Sir, I have prepared from before the midsem all the topic, but I am not confident.
You can ask from before the midsem portion.
",Medium"Before midsem, So tell me what is the difference between parameter and hyperparameter?
","Sir, I don't know sir.
",NA"How do you calculate the parameters for linear regression?
Can you explain linear regression?
","Linear regression is a mathematical model to used to calculate the relation between like dependent and independent variables.
",Medium"What is the mathematical equation?
","For linear regression sir?
y equal to theta not plus x theta 1.
",Low"What is theta 0 and what is theta 1?
","Sir, theta 0 is the intercept and the theta 1 is the, what do you call it?
Slope.
",Medium"So, given a data set, how do you find theta 0 and theta 1?
","Sir, I will write the formula?
",NA"Yes.
","Sir, I have written the formula sir.
",NA"Very good.
So let's say you have constructed this and your regression model is ready.
How do you measure the performance of a regression model?
","Sir, I will write the formula of..
",NA"How do you measure performance?
What are the metrics used?
","Sir, mean squared error, some is, some squared error, minus squared error, root minus squared error, mean squared error, they are the metrics that we are calculating.
",Low"Very good. You know there are different normalization techniques of data?
","Yes sir, there are two min max normalization and Z score normalization.
",Medium"How does this normalization process affect the calculation of this parameters?
","Like normalization is used for pre-processing of the data that if we are giving the data to the model to increase the accuracy of the model or the algorithm or to optimize the performance of the algorithm.
",Medium"But will it affect this parameter calculation?
","Sir, I am not getting you sir.
",NA"See, you have a data.
","Yes sir.
",NA"You can use the data for parameter calculation.
","Yes sir.
",NA"Now, you have the data, you can normalize and calculate the parameters. Right?
","Yes sir.
",NA"Again, will the parameters change?
","Yes sir, while normalization, the parameter will be changed sir.
",Medium"How?
","Like sir, we are normalizing in min max normalization, we give from 0 to 1 or minus 1 to 1, sir.
In Z score normalization, we keep mean value 0 and standard deviation equal to 1, sir.
",Medium"Correct.
But how does it affect this parameter calculation?
","Sir, I do not know.
",NA"How did the course go for you?
","Sir, good sir.
Good sir.
",NA"Any feedback for me?
","Sir, I like you, but I am not sure.
This is, there are so many mathematical terms in ML.
So, I am not able to remember all the terms sir like.
",Medium"That is not remember as it is understanding and interpretation.
","Yes sir.
",NA"If you try to remember, you will lose track.
If you understand, 
","I will understand, but I forgot that.
",Medium"It happens.
Thank you very much.
","Thank you sir.
",NA285,,NA"You had lunch?
","Yeah.
",NA"What did you eat?
","Rice, sambar, and sabji and egg.
",NA"Rice, sambar, sabji and egg.
They give egg in your mess?
","Yeah.
",NA"Very good.
Now suppose you are trying to calculate how many calories you have taken by mentioning which are the items you have taken.
And what kind of problem from ML perspective that is?
","How many calories the each food item has?
",Medium"No, how many calories you are consuming?
","Like what type of regression, clustering or distance?
",Medium"Yes.
","So if I classify, then it is classification.
But in overall, I guess it's regression.
",Medium"It is regression.
Okay.
What is the difference between classification and regression?
","Sir like classification is mainly works on like if I want to classify whether the gender is male or female.
Then it helps in that.
But in regression, it helps in a numeric value.
Like if I want to predict the house rent or I want to predict the stock market like that, it's what numeric value.
",Medium"If it is numeric it is a regression.
If it is not numeric, then it is classification.
","No, somehow it's like that.
According to my understanding.
",Medium"No, no you are right.
Okay.
Right.
Very good.
So is regression a supervised learning algorithm or unsupervised?
","It's supervised.
",NAWhy?,"Because it's a labeled data.
Like unsupervised is for unlabeled data like clustering is unlabeled data.
So we can use unsupervised learning.
But classification regression is a labeled data.
So we can use supervised learning.
",Medium"Okay.
Good.
So suppose you have built an regression model.
How will you find out whether it is a model which is doing good or not?
","For that we have to calculate like R square, mean square error, mean absolute error.
And from that we can conclude whether it is working correct or not.
",Medium"Can you compare between R square error and mean square error?
","Mean square and R square.
",NA"You can tell me what are the differences, what are the similarities?
","So mean R square error.
It's work on like it's formula is actually one minus actual value minus prediction value.
My actual value minus the mean of actual value.
And but R square mean square error is just actual minus prediction value whole square.
But it is R square is less sensitive to the outliners.
And mean square is sensitive to the outliners.
In comparison to R square error.
",Low"Okay.
In our calorie calculation example, which one will you use?
","I think R square will be more appropriate because it will square mean square error will square the error.
So it will become more high.
The error will become high.
",Low"In R square?
","It will be accurate for that calculation.
",Medium"R square doesn't square it?
","Yeah, it's no, it won't square it.
",Low"Sure?
","Yeah.
",NAThen why is there is R square?,"It is square but for this calculation R square will be appropriate.
I think.
",Medium"No your thinking is right, I am just trying to find out why.
Okay.
Good.
Now let's say, can you use a classification algorithm like KNN for regression?
","Yeah , There is like in types of regression, there is one KNN regression.
Yeah.
You can use it.
",LowCan you tell me how it works?,"That I don't know but I know there is a type called KNN regression.
",Medium"Okay.
What about decision tree?
","It's a supervised learning.
It is in classification.
",Medium"Can it be used for regression?
","It's a tree regression also but it's not, I don't know whether it is actual like decision tree or.
",Low"In decision tree the term decision is for classes, regression tree is for regression.
",That I know.,NA"Both are trees.
What is the difference between random forest and decision tree?
","I don't know in specific but I can say, according to the name.
Like random forest, it's works on a million, basically worls on a many trees.
But for decision tree we make a single tree and based on that tree, on a root node and leaf node we make a decision.
",Medium"Absolutely right.
Why you are saying I don't know.
","I think ML is quite confusing topic for me.
",Medium"Confusing topic for you.
Okay fine, that's okay.
It can be confusing sometimes.
It takes time to settle it.
Okay.
But nothing to worry.
You know.
Anyway you know the concepts.
You can sink in.
Now what is the difference between bagging and boosting?
","Okay.
So, bagging mainly works like, mainly walks like a subset.
So, boosting mainly works like the features which have a less learning rate.
It will boost up that feature.
And the bagging is mainly works on a data like if there is a huge number of data set, it will make a subset of a data set and it works on that.
",Medium"Is it decision tree a linear classifier or non-linear classifier?
","Decision tree?
",NA"Is it a linear classifier or non-linear classifier?
","I think it's non linear.
",NAWhy?,"Because for linear classifier we can.
I don't know.
",Low"Okay. Any questions for me?
","No sir.
",NA"You are thinking something, ask.

","No, I don't know.
No, I don't have a question.
",NA"What is your feedback on the course?
","Course or subject?
",NA"Subject.
","Okay.
Actually this subject is quite interesting like why it is going the practical way.
But when it's going for theoretically, it's quite confusing topic.
",Medium"So, which basically means I did a bad job?
","No, no, no sir.
I didn't mean that.
But while working like for prediction, I am doing some project.
Then it's quite interesting to get this type of ML is doing this type of works.
But when you have a learning theoretically, it's quite difficult to understand and calculation computation is.
",Medium"What is your feedback for me?
Be honest and open.
I don't mind even if you say that you are the nastiest fellow.
","I think I feel like it seems like that you are strict in the class.
But while talking to you in like in my van, I think you are cool to make it and you are strict about that problem. That's all.
But if someone see from...
",Medium"So, I also have confusing appearance.
","Yeah, yeah. Somehow yeah.
",NA"Okay.
Thank you.
","Thanks sir.
",NA"Please close the door.
So tell me, what have you prepared for Viva?
","So we just took the entire.
And he prepared once entire thing and came, just one hour back.
",Low"One hour back?
","I just took a brief look of entire thing sir, entire syllabus.
",NA"So tell me, what should I ask you?
What should I ask you from?
","Whichever you wish sir.
",NA"Sorry.
","Like, whichever you wish sir.
Decision tree.
",Medium"Decision tree.
So, tell me, how are decision trees constructed?
","Sir, decision trees basically, in DSA, we have regular trees, right sir.
Then we have root nodes, internal roots and leaf nodes.
We will be dividing the entire thing into trees.
And we will be able to divide the attributes.
Like, we can find the attributes using information gain and gene index.
The best attribute that we can be chosen for the spread of the data.
And in the leaf nodes, we will be able to form the clusters.
",Medium"How do you calculate information gain?
","Information gain, like, we have entropy minus, we have the formula right sir.
HS by HV log k log hk.
I don't know sir.
",Low"What is HS?
","HS minus, like, this is the observation and the total, like, total number of things that we have.
Into log of H of k, I think there will be no.
",Low"What is HS?
","HS entropy sir.
",NA"What is the formula for entropy?
","Entropy minus p of k into log of p of k, to the base 2.
",Medium"What is pk?
","Pk is, like, that's the, I can't remember that sir.
Like, I can't remember that.
Randomness sir.
",LowPk?,"Pk.
So entropy is to just an uncertainty.
And pk is, like, the value will be given for us to find the entropy.
And the value will be given in the question right sir, like, I find entropy p of k is, like, 
",Medium"Value will be given to you?
","I think so, like, in most of the questions it was given right sir.
",Medium"Seriously?

","In entropy questions that you have given, given in class, sir like, entropy is the same, a basic thing right sir.
",Medium"Okay.
So why is the pk explaining entropy?
","Sir, like, what  I have studied, like, entropy is like the randomness that we have in the system currently, environment.
And, like, p, log k will have a negative value.
So, when we multiply it with the negative value, we will get a positive entropy.
And p of k will give the measure of the, how a system varies, like, how the change happens actually.
",Medium"So let's say, decision tree is a classification algorithm.
","Yes sir.
",NA"How do we measure the performance of this tree?
","Decision tree sir?
Decision trees.
So we can judge a particular, sir, in a decision tree, if we go into the, like, further attributes.
I want to check this node, whether this node is a correct thing, like, we will be, taking this attribute for the further classification.
We can use the information gain, so, for, to find this, whether this particular node or this particular node will give the best split of the data.",Medium"Yeah, but how will that decide the performance of the tree?
","So, at the end, where we would be able to form clear clusters, sir.
This leaf nodes will form cluster, right, sir.
So, where we can get clear clustering.
",Medium"Right.
But how will you measure the performance?
","Performance of decision tree.
I forgot sir.
How we find this, sir.
",Low"What is normalization of data?
","Normalization of data, sir.
Suppose, if I have a data between 0 to 100.
Now, I can make this into a simpler form of 0 to 1.
We can use minmax.
We can use Z-score.
Like, like reducing the data.
Like, when we have a, when we want to compress and get into a smaller fraction of, suppose we have, now I have a evaluation between 0 to 79 times, sir.
Now, just to make this into a perfect sense, I can convert this into 0 to 1 right, sir.
For getting a clear idea of comparison.
Like, a larger value can be converted into a smaller value for a easy estimation.
",High"Right.
How do you reduce dimensionality?
","There are two types of reductions right, sir.
Feature estimation and feature reduction.
So, features can be like, there are two types of features extraction and features reduction.
So, like feature extraction, we will take the best features that are possible out there.
Like, out of 10 features or 10 attributes.
I will take the ones actually which will change.
Suppose, there might be few features which may not help in further class.
Like, which may not help in the output.
Like, how the end, suppose if I take x1, x2, x2, x4 and y1 is my ultimate data.
Like, attribute which I am going to check.
Now, suppose x4 and x5 may not add like changing this may not help changing this thing.
When we have a more number of attributes and we want to reduce it, so we will be able to, we can able to remove x4 and x5.
And we can reduce the attributes.
Dimensionality can be reduced.
So, number of features can be reduced.
",Medium"When you reduce the dimensionality like this, what happens to the decision tree?","If this is not a factor that affects the decision tree, if this has nothing to do with the outcome, then the decision tree will remain similar.
May remain similar.
But if the slightest change can change the decision tree also.
",Medium"So, if here is no influence on the outcome, why should you do it?
","Like, suppose, like, I can say like this.
Suppose, let us take, I have 5 attributes, sign number, name, colony and nationality and cricket league, like which for which, county he plays cricket.
So, name, colony and sign number will not affect actually the country which he is playing for.
Only the nationality, if he is an Indian, he will play for BCC.
If he is in England, he will play for like their respective.
So, only this particular attribute helps in deciding this county, like, like, ultimate, we want to decide the county.
So, we will be able to remove these features and we can make the decision only by nationality right sir.
Dimensionality is being reduced.
",Medium"Why should you reduce if it is not affecting the outcome?
","Like, when we take into consideration, we take the entire thing into consideration.
It is like the entire rate itself, like, 
",Low"Into what consideration?
","Okay, like, decision tree will divide the nationality itself.
Okay, so, like, only the main attribute can be taken which actually affects.
Okay, decision tree will be only made on the nationality.
I think it will be like, ultimately, like, this will be BCCA, this will be like England board, this is Australian and this will be like, New Zealand board.
And these will be like the intermediate nodes will be based on the nationality.
Okay, these can be, it's only nationality.
Dimensionality.
Actually, I have read, like, dimensionality reduction means, it decreases the number of attributes of features that are actually present in the dataset.
",Medium"Correct.
That is correct understanding.
Question is, how do you relate the concepts?
","Which ones sir like, decision trees and..
",Low"Feature reduction
","Dimensionality.
",NA"Suppose you reduce the dimensionality.
Will the decision tree go for underfitting overfitting?
Is there a chance?
","Dimensionality.
Suppose, if someone has done a premature dimensionality reduction, like, suppose, actually here, in the, in the, instead of name, we are taking, suppose, something like, for which brand he is endorsed.
And the brand also may be a contributing factor for the county which he is playing.
So, I am just saying, so, now, when someone prematurely remove, tries to remove just brand, then the, then the, what we say, decision tree will completely go wrong as this is also a factor is playing role in, making the decision tree.
And then this might overfit for this only particular data, nationality.
Because we can't only decide based on nationality.
We have to also check here, but here we are removing an interval.
Now, the enter thing is going to fit overfit for the nationality part.
",Medium"What is overfitting?
","Where the training data is going to be,
So, I have a training data sir, like, 60, 60 rows, I have training data.
Now, the like, overfitting naturally happens when the model tries to adapt to that particular type of data.
Like, here we have training data of 60% of data.
So, this 60, when the model tries to copy this, copy what is happening in the training model itself.
In the sense, it will not be able to see the other side of the thing.
Like, how could I say?
Suppose, here we have, in the same example, sir.
Here, nationality, here it is only adapting through the nationality.
Now, we have removed this name right, the brand value.
So, it is giving nationality Indian, it is giving BCC.
So, here the model is only adapting to, here it is finding a pattern in Indian, BCC.
England, ICC.
So, now, this will get overfit, like, on further instances, where we have ignored this thing.
And when we go to the test area, where we include this, this will, this result will be coming.
Overfitting, as I said, it tries to copy, it tries to mimic what training data has.
It tries to adapt to only to the training data, sir.
",Medium"Very good.
How will you detect it?
","Overfitting.
We can use validation data, like, we can suppose, divide into training, validation, and test right, sir.
So, we have validation dataset, to avoid the overfitting to the training data, sir.
",Medium"Correct.
But how will you detect it?
","Detect.
Maybe the accuracy will be too, sir, like, 100 percent.
When we run the epochs for the entire dataset, like, when you run, after 20 epochs, the initial accuracy will be 92 percent, like, it is completely getting only for the training model.
Maybe you can say like, that sir, when we are running, during program execution.
Before that, I don't know how to detect it.
",Medium"In what situation, you will have test accuracy more than training accuracy.
","Test accuracy more than training accuracy, sir.
Maybe, under, underfit sir.
",MediumOkay.,"How could we have training data, like, suppose, where we have equal, I can give a case, a very equal number of, like, 50-50 percent training and data sets, when we take, when we have trained the model very less, and the train, the model isn't capable enough to make its decision based on the parameters that we have given, on the data set that it already has, it might adapt to the training data, test data set, when the training is not properly happening, sir.
",Medium"Can a model adapt to test data set?
","It depends on its size, sir.
Like, if I give training model, if I give a training model 20 percent, and if I give test model, like 80 percent, it tries to fit to test data set, 
",Medium"Does the model fit to the test data set at all?
","No, underfit condition, sir.
It will give you wrong answers, sir.
And no sir, that test data set, there are not any cases where, it actually fits more than training data set.
",Medium"Okay.
How did you find the course?
","Actually, I was more into, like, front-end Android development and WebDevelopment sir, full-stack developer, and I thought of taking ML course, but I never had now this, I gained aspects of what is happening in ML sir.
And it's quite interesting, actually, because when we are dealing with machine, and when we actually the entire life itself, like, now I'm doing the project, and I will be able to understand where ML is actually being used, and it is there everywhere right sir.
So, it's very good, sir, actually.
I never thought I'm going to take, like, I never had the idea of taking, going into ML course, but just... 
",Medium"Any feedback for me?
","Ah, you're good sir, you're great, sir.
",NA"Thank you very much.
","Thank you sir.
",NA"Two eighty seven?
","Yes, sir.
",NA"what is is project based on 
","It is perceptron and clustering.
Clustering because our project is based on that.
So I know things in and out about clustering.
And then I went, I did find some interest about in perceptron.
So I read through perceptron as well.
",MediumSo where do you want me to ask you?,"Up to you, sir.",NA"Clustering.
Okay.
How do you measure the performance of a clustering algorithm?
","Using metrics such as, silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, which is DB index, and the, Calinski-Harabasz index, which is the CH index.
So you can actually, like, in, for example, if you're doing k-means clustering, and now you need to find the optimal number of clusters or k values.
Now, how will you find that?,based on the plot.
If, if you plot these three indexes as a graph, you can get to know from the values.
So silhouette score tells you about how, how well your data point belongs to a particular cluster, like how well it fits into the cluster.
So higher the silhouette score, the more optimal your k value could be.
That is one criteria.
Then DB index gives you a ratio of the distance of the points within the cluster, and the distance between the clusters.
Like it tells how, how well formed your clusters are, and how well separated your clusters are.
And CH index also does the similar thing as DB index, but it's a different ratio that's taken there.
It's like, it's, I don't remember the formula well, but then what I know is a ratio again between the inter cluster and intra cluster distance.
So the lower, the lower your DB index, it tells you that your cluster is well formed.
Like, your cluster is more compact.
And your CH index is ,the more higher your CH index is,the more better your cluster is.
So based on these three metrics, you can find your optimal cluster.
",HighWhich clustering algorithm worked best for you?,"For our project?
We, so we used k means, mean shift.
We also tried hierarchical , but hierarchical did not give us good values.
So we only stuck to k means and mean shift.
So our project, like we had to find clusters based on the, the answers to mathematical questions.
So it found out, like we could find out that the clusters are forming on the basis of the types of questions and answers.
So maybe for example, say if someone's answering quadratic questions, like quadratic questions and their answers.
So that's forming one cluster.
Someone's answering speed distance time question, it's forming one cluster.
So we could see well separated clusters in terms of k means and mean shift, rather than hierarchical.
Because hierarchical,it goes like cluster and then,within cluster there are sub clusters.
It is difficult to carry out more bifurcations for the questions.
",LowWhat is normalization technique?,"Can I tell you types also?
Normalization is when like your data set, if it contains like vague values, and if you want to scale it down to maybe uniform values, that's when you use normalization.
Normalization I know two types, MinMax and ZScore.
ZScore involves your mean and standard deviation.
MinMax as from the name, it involves the minimum and the maximum values from your data point.
",Medium"Right.
In which situation you should use which algorithm?
","ZScore or MinMax?
Not sure.
But I think in a place where you need to find your deviation, like where your deviation matters a lot.
I think ZScore would perform well, I think.
Because in MinMax,there's no mean or standard deviation involved.
It's just Min and Max.
I think,I don't know sir, I'm not really sure.
Like I'm just going on a formula basis.",HighWhat is the formula for MinMax?,"I'll write it.
Sir,should I write it on that?",NASorry?,Should I write it on that one or this?,NA"No no no ,Anywhere.","I have one more term.
I think this is the formula.
Like this is your input, like you are trying to change, like normalize.
And then there'll be two points, A and B, which will be given.
Yeah, this is the formula I know.
",LowWhat does this formula do?,"It's a normalization formula.
It normalizes your, if the, okay, so this is x value, right?
It could be, like we're trying to get it into a particular range.
Like we're trying to normalize it for that data set.
What it's doing is we have two values, for example, if it's given in a question, A and B, and we are trying to find the minimum value, the maximum value, and then trying to compute it for each iteration.
",Low"Yeah, but what does the different parts of the formula do?
What do they do?
Why this formula make sense to be used for a MinMax normalization?","I'm not sure, sir.
I will look to it.",NA"Okay.
Now, how does this process of normalization affect your clustering?
k-means clustering if I say?
","Okay, so can I take it on the example of our project itself?
",LowYes.,"So, our data set contains questions and answers that the students are given, and there's also another column called Marks, because we were also trying to find a relation if clusters are forming on the basis of Marks.
Now, if we were to apply normalization in this case for the Marks column, for say, if we apply normalization, and it normalizes everything to maybe, like we have Marks ranging from 0 to 5.
And if it normalizes everything to maybe say, maybe say, 0 or 2, all the readings maybe to 0 or 2.
Now, if we perform k-means, now we have used embeddings also.
So, now what the model would do?
It finds multiple values of 0s, multiple values of 2s that are in,
it has normalized the values to.
Now, it would sort of put a weight on the clustering that it would probably cluster all 0 Marks wala questions together, and 2 marks questions together.
Rather than focusing on the main criteria, that is, okay, here we can say that it's maybe classifying based on Marks, but it's not all the Marks together.
It's only 0 Marks and 2 Marks, like the other Marks are gone.
So, it might sort of ignore few of the data points that were maybe valid to the data set.
In that case, I think normalization would cause an error in terms of clustering, as far as I understand it.",High"It was a very specific example.
But generally, how will it affect?","Like normalization?
It might ignore few important features.
Like in your data points, like if you have specific data points which might, which would have affected your result, now you have ignored that data point completely.
Like it isn't there in your data sets, since you have normalized everything to a uniform value, which matches your requirement.
But maybe, you know, it might affect your performance metrics as well, like in not in case of clustering, like in case of any model, if you're trying to find accuracy or you know precision, recall, it might affect the metrics there, because everything is being regarded as uniform now, because it's normalized.
So, it might ignore that important feature that you are trying to find out.
",High"Okay.
And even if it ignores, why do you think it will adversely affect the clustering?
",Can I take a different example?.,NAOkay.,"Yeah.
Okay, so, maybe, okay.
So adverse effects, I would like to maybe, it related with healthcare.
Okay, somewhere.
So, in healthcare, now if you're trying to form clusters based on readings, maybe from an MRI, maybe, reading from an MRI.
Now, if you normalize readings from an MRI, which is not right in the first place, because all like readings can't be normalized in case of healthcare.
You cannot ignore even a single reading, correct?
So, now if we try to normalize readings from an MRI machine that it gives, maybe get it to some form that we want, and then we form clusters.
Now, from the MRI doing this, we might get some result that, okay, this person has this issue, but it's not really right, because we have ignored the very specific points in terms of MRI here.",LowHow would clustering help you identify this issue?,As in? ,NAYou said that this person might have this issue.,"Yeah, like clusters as in based on values.",NA"Correct.
How are they related to issues?","That I'm not sure.
So, maybe, take medical readings, and in terms of medical sector only, if we take readings from any of the instruments that we are using, and in the first place, it's not right to normalize all of them, because there will be deviations, even in heart rate monitor, there are deviations of our heart rate, like we can normalize heart rate right?
So, even in that case, if you try forming clusters, you will only know initially that, since it's healthcare data, you should be very, very careful with the data.
So, you should know the type of data that you're handling.
In our case, it's just like mathematical questions.
So, we can trial and do experimentation and find out, but then this is medical sector, so it depends on sector as well.
So, I think I'll come back to the quadratic questions again.
So, it's like now, so what is the question again?
I forgot the question.
",MediumHow does normalization affect clustering?,"Again, like the same example I told, like 0 marks, 2 marks.",NA"Are you convinced about your answer?
or are you just giving some answer?","I think I'm convinced.
Because you're trying to normalize the data, so you're trying to get it in like a uniform format, so there it doesn't have much difference in like the values.
So, if you're trying to do that, what I'm trying to say is, it might ignore a few like
",MediumWhy would it ignore?,"You're normalizing, right?",NA"By normalizing, are you losing the identity of the..","Not completely, no no, not completely.",NAThen?,"Within few, like in between few instances of the data might be lost.
Few, not all, maybe few.",LowWhy would it be lost?,"Again, I'm normalizing the data, that's why.",Medium"By normalization, how can values be lost?","No, not like values be lost, but the values will get changed to the normalized value.
",Medium"Yeah, but just in another scale, like... You have temperature in fahrenheit, you have temperature in celsius.
You are migrating from one to another, do you think the values will get lost?
","No, ",NAThen?,only the formula changes.,Mediumcorrect.,Yeah.,NASame is normalization.,"So, if you apply normalization, and if you don't, there will be a difference in like, in case of the similarity matrix.
Some difference will be there, like maybe minimal difference will be there, but not a lot.
",MediumSimilarity matrix?,"No, like the, the index, the CH index, DB index.
And then the silhouette score.
Some minimal change will be there.
",Low"Will it be?
Add their ratios.
","DB and CH, it won't be there.
Silhouette I'm not sure.
Silhouette I'm not sure.
DB and CH, it won't be there, because they are inter and intra-clustrolite.",Low"And relationship between them.
So, relationship basically means there is a ratio.
",Ha.,NA"When there is a ratio, does the absolute value matter?",No.,NAHow did the course go for you?,"Sir, it went well, like I understood like concepts, like really well, like it went, like it didn't go too fast, like it was properly paced, like I could understand.
Like in between, I mean, I, I fell sick in between, like during regression classes.
I couldn't catch up a lot in regression, but I tried.
So, yeah, like the course went well, and then like real-life examples, and then solving questions also, helped a lot, like to understand how exactly you're applying, like formulas tho you can give it even in ppt and slides, but then how do you know where you're applying, and how do we know how exactly to calculate something, and know if it's right or wrong.
So, in that way it helped.
And then labs also, yeah, like we did have guides, but then like we didn't know if like the codes that you had given the link for, we used the same codes, but then we had to obviously change it according to our data set and make some alter, like we had to alter it.
So, we weren't sure if altering that was completely correct or completely wrong also.
So, in that manner, yeah like lab was okay, theory was good.
",MediumAny feedback for me?,"It was good, sir.
Like it was like a well paced class, like not too fast, not too slow.
Compared to other subjects, it's better.
",HighHave you responded to the faculty feedback?,Yeah.,NAThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA"Good afternoon.
Right.
So, shall we start?
",Yes sir.,NAGood?,Yes sir.,NAWhere do we start?,"Sir,",NALook at this.,Yes.,NA"Yes, tell me.
What should I ask you?",On KNN?,NAKNN?,"Yes, sir.",NAOther than that?,"Other than that,SVM?",Medium"SVM, okay, fine.
So, please explain why SVM is a supervised learning algorithm.
","Sir, because it's the decision of, let's say that, it separates the dataset into to n different classes based on hyperplane.
The hyperplane is like, it can be a line or a plane for three classes like that.
It will be plane that straight line, it divides straight line, because of that it's a supervised learning.
For unsupervised, it will be like some different shapes, curves, it will be like that.And..
That's it sir.
",MediumThat's it?,Yeah.,NA"Okay.
So,that is why it is a supervised learning.
",Yeah.,NA"Okay.
If you say so.
Now, take one problem, problem from around and which can use SVM as an algorithm, okay?
And tell why you chose SVM for that problem.
","sir, imagine in a school, like two teams are there.
One is football team and the other is paint, painting, painting person.
So these people, like, there's only one ground in that school, sir.
So half of the ground will play football and half, they'll start do painting.
And sometimes the ball goes into the painting and then obviously it will disturb the paint aside sir.
So, for fixing this problem, obviously we need a line to divide them, to divide two teams.
",MediumOkay.,"So, obviously, like, exactly, if it is 50% or 70%, the line divides that football team and then paint team.
But a buffer zone should be there, sir.
Because obviously, one line can't divide two teams right sir.
So buffer zone, it creates buffer zone.
So, one side, it can be football team and another side, painting person.",Medium"Okay.
Right.
So, why did you choose SVM for this?

","To divide exactly, like, to divide two groups separately, sir.
Separate them.",Medium"That you can do with any algorithm, why SVM?
","Why SVM means,
So, like, straight lines will divide right sir.Both should have same importance.Both should have..
",Low"Hmmm,tell me.","It separates two teams equally right sir,with the straight line.

",Medium"Why do you need that separation?
","Why do you need?
Obviously, the playground goes to each,like equally distributed right sir?.",Low"Once the game starts, they are not in one side like that right?","Buffer zone is there right, sir.
Line is like this.
And then, like, gutters will be there no sir.
Both teams, gutter points.
So, with that, buffer zone creates right, sir.
Within that limit, only they will play.
And that here, this painting will also paint in that their zone.
",Low"Okay, very good.
So, you need a buffer zone, so SVM.
",Yes sir.,NA"What is the buffer zone called in SVM?
Does it have a name?","Yes, sir.
It has.",NAWhat is the name?,"That is hyperplane And the points last is gutters, that... 

",Low"No idea?
Okay, Margin.
",Margin.,NA"Is it called Margin?
How do you measure the performance of SVM?
","Performance of SVM, sir?.",Low"Hmm.
","Measuring performance.
Supervised learning it is,
F1 score, accuracy.
Ah, for classifying it is, F1 score, accuracy, precision, recall.",Medium"F1 score, accuracy, precision,recall.
","Hmm.
",NA"Okay.
What is the difference between accuracy and precision?
","Precision, it will tell how many positives are there.
It predicts how many positives are there.
",Low"Precision?
","It tells how many positives are there.
It predicts.
It predicts how many positives are there.
",Low"Accuracy doesn't?
","Ah, accuracy will like,
It will tell about everything.
How many false,how many positives?
Like TP plus FN by everything right sir.
So overall, it will tell.
How accurately it is correct.
",Medium"How accurately it is correct.
Okay, interesting terminology.
I like it.
Very good.
Right.
So now, okay.
So now, you do normalization of data.
",Yes sir.,NA"What are the normalization techniques?
",Min-max method and Z score.,NA"Which one is better?

","I feel min-max method, sir.

",MediumWhy?,"Because if the data is too long, it will, ah, it will scale into, ah, like, a specified range.
",Medium"What is the drawback of min-max?
","Drawback,
It's high-sensitive to outliers.
High-sensitive to outliers.",Low"Okay.
Now suppose you normalize the data.
How will it affect your SVM classifier?
","If we normalize the data.
The performance will be better, sir.
The, ah, the values of reference score, precision, recall, it will differ a lot.
Like, it will give better results.",Medium"It will give better results?
","Yes sir.

",NA"Okay.
If you say so.
How do you fill missing values?","Uh, mean, mode.",NAAnything.,"Anything in the sense?
",NA"I mean, anywhere you can use mean,anywhere you can use mode.

","No, sir.
Like, mode is like, less sensitive to outliers.",Medium"Mode is less sensitive to outliers.
And mean is more sensitive to outliers.
I think what of your today is outliers.
You seem to love outliers like anything.","No sir,nothing like that.",NA"Nothing like that.
Okay.
All right.
How did you like the course?
","It's nice interesting, sir.
It's new, right, sir, for us.
Learning about this classifier, regression, string.
So even the code is like, it's running too long, sir.
It's like a way too,it's not big code, but it's taking too long for our projects.
Even we asked Meena Maam for this computers are there right sir?, with the high-end CPU.
We asked Meena Mam,she gave,but still it's like,yesterday night only, I put the one code, six hours, but still now no results.
",Low"Okay.
That is why it is a good course.
That is why it's a good course a?
","Not, like, interesting subject sir.
",NA"Interersting,Okay.
Any feedback for me?","For you, sir, sir.
It's like, you taught us very differently, sir, because every teacher, like, put one ppt and, they'll tell about the ppt.
And before exam they'll send the ppt,obviously we'll read the ppt, and we'll write.
But yours is like, no notes will be provided, we have to write it.
It's different and it's too good, sir.
",Medium"Thank you.
Anything else?
","No sir.
",NA"Thank you very much.
","Thank you sir.
",NA What is your project?,"
Project is basically classification of answers based on the questions we have not considered actually,but we were just,based on different domains and we are using regression for it.",Low"Your project is on classification and you are using..
","No no no I am sorry, relevance of answer,sorry sir.
Relevance of answer,we are using regression for it and we are,for various domains we are trying to see what the score is basically based on regression.
",Low"So, why do you say it is a regression problem?
","Because it has various numbers where in which we are assigning the scores from 0 to 5.
So, it will throw us the output would be thrown in numbers and that is why we have done regression essentially.
",Medium"Okay.Can you do regression if your output value is categorical?
","Yes sir, we can use logistic regression.
Logistic regression because that is,it is used for classification type models in case it is categorical.
",Medium"Can you write the formula for logistic regression?
","So, I am not sure what formula.",NA"Then how do you know logistic regression is used for classification?
","Its...I am not sure sir.
I know it is used for classification but I am not sure based on the formula.",Medium"So, if it is a classification algorithm why is it called regression?","It is a regression but it is used primarily for classification problems.
It is used in a lot of classification problems.

",Medium"Why,what is wrong with other regression algorithms?
They can also be used for classification?","I do not know sir.
",NA"How many regressors have you used?
","We have used linear regressor, polynomial regressor, we have used lasso regressor.
Then for non-traditional we have used SVM, we have used decision trees, We have used so traditional and non-traditional we have classified them and used them.
",MediumPlease explain how you are using decision tree for regression.,"So, essentially we have taken up.
So, decision tree we have a set of embeddings from Roberta, Perth and GPT which were throwing us our input.
Then we are plotting a decision tree based on the various..Not sure sir,project sir,not so perfect.
",Low"Where am I asking project?
","Sir..
",NA"I am asking you theory.
I am not asking you project.","Sir, that day I will be ready.
",NA"Which day?
","On project evaluation day,I'll know the theory of it sir.
",Medium"You will know the theory of it.Okay.
Now, suppose you have categorical variables as data.
What will you do to use it for your regression?
","If we have categorical variables, how will we assign it for regression?
So, we essentially had used, we had classified it into various classes like L labels which is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
So, based on those labels we are basically encoding our data set.
And that data set is then refined sent through the classifier based on its embeddings.
And then we are throwing out based on the regression models we are throwing out the answer.",Medium"So, how do you know which regressor is good?
","Based on various performance metrics it can be RMSC, MSC, some square errors, R square based on all of these we can classify whether or not a regressor is good.",Medium"So, you have so many numbers?
Which number are you using?","Whichever, R square should be close to 1 for a good ,perfect model.
But if it is nearly close to 1, it will be a perfect model.
And for RMSC, SSC and MSC whichever is closer to 0.
So, whichever model satisfies all of these, closely satisfies some of these parameters, I think we distinguish that as the best running model.",Medium"Let us say you measured R square and it came one.
What would be its equivalent RMSC value?
What is the relationship between RMSC and R square?
","1 minus RSS divided by TSS is for R square.
So, for RSS we take that as minus by dash the whole square.
So, this part will be so we are saying that this whole thing is equating to essentially this part TSS is 1 minus by dash.
So, this whole equation will be equating to 0.
So, essentially a y minus y dash will also be approximately could be equal to 0 if we are, if we are, so RMSC would also essentially be equal to 0.","Good,very good.
Yeah, This is called systematic analysis.
Very good.
How does dimensionality affect your R square?
","If the, it won't essentially because it is regression, it won't affect our R square value significantly because we are not using..,label encoding might affect the R square value in certain cases, but because we will be using either one hot encoding or one of the other encoding.
So, it would not affect our RMSC, it would stay stagnant because we are using regression.
","Why label encoding will change the RMSC?
","Because certain classes will be given majority classes, maybe the computer might not understand.
It might give it majority classes.
So, in that case the dimensionality will affect the RMSC.
",How do dimensionality affect RMSC?,"I do not know how to explain it sir,
Label encoding might affect it, but one hot will not.
For regression it won't throw an error.
For RMSC it won't be throwing and essentially it won't throw an error even if we use regression.",Okay. What is overfitting?,"Overfitting is basically in what context sir,like
","Tell the summary?
Overfitting means the same irrrespective of the context.

",I know.,NA"Tell me some other?
Overfitting means the same irrrespective of the context.","I know.
",NA"You know multiple overfittings?,Okay,explain one of them.
","No, no sir.
If we take KNN classification and we have, if the k value is tinier so,all of the,I mean all of the attributes will try to align itself to that one class.
So, that will be overfitting.
Most of the attributes are trying to align.
The model itself is trying to align to one of the parameters.
Whereas underfitting is when there are lots of parameters, then the model does not know, it cannot quite categorize where it should be.
So, it won't be able to throw the right answer.

",Low"So, you want regression or KNN?","So, overfitting in general,means that, 
",Medium"You take any model and explain overfitting there.
","Yes.Okay sir.
Sir, regression, I am not able to answer properly.
So, in KNN classification when K value is smaller, we will have only one neighbor.
So, in that case, only the, it will assign, so all of the values, let's say a model is asking for dog or cat.
The majority class will be dog.
So, in that case, even if a cat is supposed to be assigned as a cat, it will align itself to the majority class itself and give the wrong prediction.
",Medium"But, you have small where is majority?
","Sir, like K is equal to one means it will give you only,
",LowThere is no majority.,"It will give only dog as the prediction.
That will lead to overfitting.",Medium"It won't put every cat into dog, na?","No, sir.
But, like it will only throw a dog as an output essentially.
",Low"Why?
","That, because it will be, it's overfit to such a model that it can only recognize,
",Low"How do you detect overfitting?
When do you say overfitting is happening?
","When the r square value in case of, overfitting occurs when, are expected especially with unsupervised learnings when we get, because regression is an unsupervised learning.
When we get values of RMSC and all of them, it should range between 0 and 1, but we are getting either negative 1 or in case if,
It should align itself to 1, but we are getting a very low value of r square.
That time we can detect that where the overfitting or underfitting condition is taking place.
",Medium"How do you find out your vectors are independent of each other or not?
","Using cosine, we can use the similarity.
Cosine similarities can be used.
So, if the two vectors are independent of each other, they will have a cosine similarity of,
They will have a cosine index of 1.",LowIf they are independent?,"If they are independent.
They will have a cosine index.Yes,sir.
No, that is completely similar.
Cosine index is zero, is orthogonal.
If they are independent, then they will have a cosine index.
This is orthogonal,90 degrees.
Cosine 0 is written as one.
So, they will be similar.
Cosine is minus 1.
So, they are 1 sir.I think so.
They would be..
",LowCosine 1 means they are independent.,"If cosine is 90, they will be independent.
So, in case of cosine is 0, it will be independent.
They will be orthogonal.
In case of cosine, 1, they will be taken as similar, completely similar vectors.
",Medium"What is the formula for cosine similarity?
","Vector of A dot product of vector of B divided by root of vector.
We find the vector A root of vector.
",Low"What is root of vector?
","When we have x, y, when we have i and j factor, we square them and we try to find the norm of that vector.That will be taken as root of vector.
",Medium"What is that A with 2 bars by its side like bodyguards?
","That is vector representation.
Based on the value, they are in 2 dimensional vectors.
So, i and j will represent the unit vectors of each of them.
So, the value of let's say A or B, then we will take A square plus B square as the norm of this is taken as A.
The magnitude of A vector, into magnitude of B vector.",Medium"So, when you put A bar, what does it mean?
That is what you have written.",Magnitude of A.,NA"Magnitude of A.
So, you multiply magnitude of A to the magnitude of B.
And what is in the denominator?","This is a dot product of A and B vectors.

",Medium"So, magnitude of A is a vector or a scalar value.
",It is a scalar value.,Medium"So, how can you do dot product of scalar values?
",Dot product itself gives us scalar values itself.,Medium"But, What are you doing?
You are doing scalar into scalar right?","Sir, the multiplication is wrong sir,
I know the concept.",Low"Okay.
How do you reduce dimensionality?","We have various techniques like where in which we can use transformation techniques and we have reduction techniques.
Under transformation techniques, We have PCA which is proportionality component analysis, where in which we define various vectors into proportions.
And then we basically in transformation vectors, we define the features.
The features are then reduced into, they are extracted, they are modified by using statistical and mathematical models into other features by retaining just the information.
So, PCA we just incorporate them into proportionality component and then we define the.
",Medium"Then it reduces the dimension.
","We try to reduce the dimension using..
I am not sure.
In the other, in reduction, we filter, we have filter and wrapper methods.
So, in filter we try to pick out the features which are throwing majority, which have a majority influence on our overall factors.
And for wrapper we apply certain techniques on the filtered methods to in order to find out the accuracy.
",Medium"Okay.
So, that is how you do dimensionality reduction.
If you reduce the dimensionality by this technique, will your R square value go down or it will remain same?","If we reduce the dimensionality using these techniques.
R square value might improve.",HighWhy?,"Because if the vector is longer, then it might lead to a, if the dimension of the vector is larger, then it could lead to certain, what do we say?
It could, if it is, if it is seven, eight, two, it is always prefer to reduce the dimension of the vector significantly using PCA techniques.
So, that they can throw better accuracy in terms of regressive methods also.
They are likely to throw better accuracy.
",Low"Okay.
Good.
Any questions for me?
","Sir, will you leave me if I tell no?",Medium"How did the course go for you?
","Sir, I learned quite of, I didn't think I'd learn so much in ML.
I've actually, I've tried to push myself and learn something outside of just what the confinement says.
And I've taken a lot of notes.
It's very helpful for next semester.",MediumAny feedback for me?,"No, sir.
Sir, if you can incorporate more sums when you're teaching the concept, you do the sums after the concept itself.
The time that train of thought is harder to correlate.
Even when we're learning KNN, we learn it theoretically, sir that's what I think some of us faced in class.
We weren't able to correlate with how it worked.
Once we were able to solve the sum, we were able to correlate quite well what the it works.
",MediumI'm never lenient on good student.,"So, I don't think I'll come back to it.Thank you sir.",Medium"That is for me to assess, isn't it?
",,NA"So tell me, what should I ask you?","Sir Sir I have studied from mainly from like before midsem part like starting what are the models in ML like KNN and algorithms and decision tree and before thing parts sir.

",LowWhy? What happened after midsem?,"Sir, no, Sir, like I had just now like project presentation of other subjects. So yesterday only I was studying this part sir.",Medium"I am not talking about studying yesterday, I am talking throughout the semester. 

",Yes Sir.         ,NAWhat are ensemble models? Can you name some?,Sir.,NAWhat are ensemble models?,"Ensemble models, Sir, Ensemble models.

Models like I don't know that names what you are asking. I don't know sir.
",LowDo you know what is bagging and boosting?,"Bagging and boosting? No, Sir.",MediumWhat are the performance metrics used for clustering?,Sir for for KNN clustering we use K as and min this one like so when we see that graph mainly it comes under like U shape that bottom most we use as an K nearest this thing for KNN clustering.,MediumWhat is the difference between parameters and hyper parameters,"Sir for parameters for any, for any, for any of the for training the main thing we use is parameter above that what and all we use like which which more for stresses on the on outcome. That is, we are used for a cipher parameter.",LowSorry.,"What when we stress for output, what stresses something more that we call it as hyperparameter can?

",Low"Can you give an example?

","Sir umm so for example min max normalization I will take for any like like in that formula as there are many variables like first is A minus A Max by a Max by a min and B Max minus B min A acts as an hyper parameter. rest ALL acts as normal parameters.

",MediumWhat are activation functions?,"Activation functions, Sir. I don't know Sir about activation.   I don't know about activation functions sir.

",Low"In a KNN classifier, what happens if K is equal to number of training patterns?","In KNN, classifier in K is equal to number of classifiers.

",MediumTraining patterns.,"Number of training patterns Sir. There will be N number of training patterns, N number of labels will be there Sir. KNN clustering will be only for for clustering into one part into different labels, labels, labels, labels. So how much of amount of K will be there? That much amount of training patterns will be there, Sir.",MediumWhat are the performance matrix used for regression?,"Sir for regression like we use k also value Sir and for for Sir we we use like Y. For separating between two classes, we used y is equal to mx plus c like mx stands or in m stands for the slope for separating the matrix. For example, when you take it as a line, line as an for separating classes.

",Medium"That is, what is cosine similarity?","So in cosine similarity like there are many similarities like jaccard similarities or cosine similarity. In cosine similarity, what we do is it will give, it will take, it will give the angle of the vectors like A dot B by by taking the individual product of A and individual product of B dividing itself.  That is formula like. It will deal with vectors and a.
So dot product for cosine similarity.
",MediumWhat is A? What is B?,"Sir, when they will give at 2 observation values, that is observation values of A and observation values of B sir. Like for a they will give 5 and.",LowHow do you calculate what is A dot B?,"Sir, A dot B we calculate it by A and AB of first one and B&A&A of 2nd, B of second one and adding.",LowWhat does this tell you?,"Sir, this gives an angle like any in any plane the angle will be there. No Sir, this cosine angle it will give I think so sir.",LowSo this gives the angle angle in degrees or radians or what is it?,"Not in degree, Sir.

",NA"Radians.

","Not in. It gives a value Sir. Not in any kind of degree format, but.

",LowYou said it is giving angle.,"It is giving a similarity, Sir.",LowWhat does similarity mean here?  How does it tell similarity?,"Sir, in case of other similarities we don't use any vector as an like input to calculate but in cosine similarity we use vector values given.  Whereas in this thing in previously in Jaccard similarity and all we use binary digits like 0 or one format like F1 divided by.",MediumDon’t go to Jaccard and all there. How does this formula tell anything about similarity?,"Very vector similarity.

",NAWhy? Why that formula should mean similarity? Explain.,"Sir, I just solved the numericals sir like I did not in detail learn about theoretical part of cosine similarities.",MediumHow did the course go for you?,"Sir, course was Sir. It was very different when compared to other subjects. Mainly in other subject it was mainly like theory, theory based, theory based, continuous exam, exam exam or written based. But this was somewhat like new experience with where we first faced in this course. Like we had a hackathon, we had the lab implementation part and we have done like mainly every week, every week, every week we had to submit our assignments into GitHub like that helped more than learning theoretical part. We are done like practically and learned the models which helped not only for that moment for that particular assignment we have completed not just for the submissions like for hackathon sake and all. It helped really well Sir. Like it gave a like basic like first time we participated in hackathon in this sem itself. Like first what you are telling us. We had participated in some other hackathon also like I had told you like we one also Sir.Like in college only like we had an 3rd place and we got cash price also for that. Like it was helping in a practical way, Sir, that is what.",MediumAny feedback for me?,Sir Nothing Sir like what you gave us. It was like we not need to compare but you are the like it was best. Sir like you are taken like some 80 classes like still now we are no teacher took like 80 classes like it was amount of class also amount of knowledge also it was very good Sir by the end of.,MediumThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA"Please close the door.
So,Tell me what should I ask you?
","Sir, decision tree.
",NA"Decision tree.
How is decision tree used for regression problem?
","Sir, decision tree classifier.",NA"Okay,regression tree?","Sir, I didn't go through regression.
I only went through decision tree classifier.
",High"Decision tree classifier.
Okay, so tell me how is a decision tree constructed?","So initially the data set will be taken as the root node.
And then based on…",Medium"The data set will be taken as the root node.Okay.
","Based on a specific feature, the LB split and then... ",Medium"How do you split?
","We split, we try verifying, or you can use cross validation to get the proper split.
According to that split, if information gain is higher, we keep that split.
If information gain is lower, you don't use that split.
",High"Information gain.
","Yes sir.
",NA"How do you calculate information gain?
","It is a system entropy minus the leaf node's entropy.
H(S)-H(Si)
",High"Okay, how do you calculate the system entropy?
","The system entropy is minus log... No, minus summation of probability log probability.
",Medium"That is the formula?
","Yeah,minus in the front.
",NA"Why there is a minus?
","A good question sir.
",NA"Thank you.
","Not sure sir, I just memorized the formula.
",Medium"Okay, what is that probability?
","It's the probability of a variable as in... And suppose there's a table.
And then... 
",Medium"Why don't you take an example and explain?
","Yeah, like... marital status.
Yes, yes, no, yes.
And if we have to calculate the system entropy for...
If we have to calculate the split for this, then entropy will be...
Minus...
",Medium"So this marital status, yes, no, whatever you have put, is that one of the features?
","Yeah.
",NA"Okay.
","You take minus 3 by 4, log 3 by 4, and then minus 1 by 4, log 1 by 4.
",High"So this probability is the probability of occurrence of different values of the feature.
","Yes.
It is the probability of the outcomes of the feature.
",High"But you took the different values of the feature.
Isn't it?
","Yes.
",NA"Or did I make a mistake in understanding what you are explaining?
","The outcome of the feature only.
You take the probability of the summation of the outcome of the features.
No, summation of the minus probability log probability of the features.
Yes.
",Medium"So you take this is system entropy.
",Okay,NA"So you have yes and no.
So you calculated the probability 3 by 4, log 3 by 4, and then minus 1 by 4, log 1 by 4.
So you will split.
How will you split?
","You need one more feature.
Suppose there is boy girl, or man, or woman, and then their marital status is yes, no, yes, no.
And you split based on that.
Like 3.
",Medium"So you are splitting one feature.
You are splitting one feature based on the another feature.
","No, you're taking one feature as the root node.
",High"How do you take that root node?
That is the question.
So you said one is marital status yes, no.
Other is let's say sex, which is boy or girl, Okay?
So combining these two features can you explain how you find the root node?
","Sir,trial and error.
",NA"Trial and error.
Okay.
Okay.
Fine.
So let's say you have constructed a decision tree.
","Okay.
",NA"How will you find out whether this construction is a good tree or a bad tree?
","So if the information gain is high for the split, then it's a good split and good tree.
",High"But there is no more split.
You have already constructed that.
","Oh then we should make sure there is no overfitting underfitting.
",Medium"Yeah.
Overfitting underfitting.
How do you find whether the decision tree has overfitting or not?
","Sir if the tree is too long, the depth goes for too long probably overfit occurs.
And if the depth is too small then it will be underfitting.
",High"So this too long, too sort are abstract statements, qualitative statements.
Okay.
So if I put like, you know, okay, you have got good marks, then you pass.
If you get bad marks, then you fail.
Then I can't declare you pass or fail.
","Yeah.
",NA"I have to have some number.
","Yeah.
",NA"So here is too long, too short is abstract.

",So then the hyperbolic parameter depth should have a value.,Medium"Yes.
So how will you decide?
","We assume the size of the data set may be.
",Low"Okay.
So let's say you have 100 features.
","Okay.
",NA"So what should be the right size of that tree?
So that it doesn't have overfitting.
","Okay.
So 5 may be, okay.
",NA"If you have 1000 features?
","10.
",NA"10.
And if you have 5 features?
","Hmm.
1.
I'm not sure.
",NA"Okay.
How is decision tree sensitive to data normalization?
","I think you normalize the data first then you build the tree.
",High"Yeah correct.
Is the tree construction sensitive to data normalization?
That is, if I don't normalize the data, will it affect my tree construction?
","Yes.
Outliers will be there, no sir.
",Medium"So you say yes, it will affect.
","Yes.
Or it might like only one side of the node will keep getting built and other side won't.
",Medium"Okay.
And how about filling missing values with central tendencies?
Will that affect your decision tree construction?
","Yes sir.
The frequency will change right of each split filling of the missing values.
",Medium"So with normalization, the frequency changes?
","Yes.
",NA"When normalization, frequency also changes, okay, can you tell me how?
","For example, you handle outliers with Z-score that will make the tree more less prone to overfit, undrfit.",High"Okay.
Interesting answer.
","Okay.
",NA"How did the course go for you?
","Sir, it was fine.
",NA"Any feedback for me?
","No sir.
I think one of the best faculty I've had.
",High"Thank you very much.
Okay.
",,NA"So,please tell me what have you prepared?
","Sir, basically like, after mid semester, due to health issues, I could not concentrate.
I did not come to college.
Sir, before mid semester, I can..
",Low"You did not attend any class after midsem?
","I attended classes sir.
But I couldn't concentrate.
",Medium"What health issues did you have?
","Like sinus problems sir.
And like, due to weather, I did not and like here in bangalore,like I did not get time,
Like, I was hospitalized,
Like, for a, almost, almost every week.
Like, issue was there,so I could not concentrate.
",Low"Okay.
So, can you tell me what is normalization of data?
","Normalization of data,
So basically when there is complex data points like a training we'll normalize 
",Medium"What do you mean by complex data points?
",Imbalance data.,NA"Imbalance data.
What is imbalance data?
",Like..,NA"Okay can you tell me how do we fill missing values?
If we have missing values in data what do we do?
","Basically we will use the concept called label encoding sir.
So we will convert categorical data into numerical data and we'll use sir.
",Mediu  "But when you have missing values how will you do encoding?
Values are non-existent.
Can you tell me the performance metrics used for classification?
","Shwartz coefficient, Kolinsky coefficient and Devis coefficient sir,Devis Index.
",NA"Can you write the formula for Manhattan distance in n-dimensional space?
",Okay sir.,NA"Ok. Can you write the formula for Jaccard Similarity and tell me where is Jaccard similarity used and why?
Give one example situation.
","Ok sir.
",NAWhat does that mean?,"Given A and B, two sets Jaccard Similarity is calculated.
The number of common things in both the sets A and B divided by number of elements in set A plus number of elements in set B minus number of elements common in both A and B.
",Medium"What is this set A set B?
","Sir,two sets.
",NA"Yeah but how does this relate to Jaccard Similarity?
Okay can you tell me what is rank of a matrix?
","So the rank of a matrix is a value, which the determinant of the matrix becomes zero.
",Medium"The rank of a matrix is the value where the determinant of a matrix will becomes zero.
Okay.Do you know what is high dimensional data and what are the problems we face because of high dimensionality?
","Overfitting and underfitting sir.
",NA"Overfitting and,okay so tell me what is overfitting?

","Overfitting in sense like when there are few data points.
So when we are trying those data points will be able to train on dataset but when we try to generalize it to new examples it won't be able to.
",Medium"Very good.
How did the course go for you?
","Sir it was fine but later after the midesem I couldn't concentrate so in these holidays I thought I will work on all those things.
",Medium"Sure, And any feedback for me?
","No sir, it was absolutely fine like before midsem I was completely comfortable like I was understanding superb.
I was able to perform.
",Low"It's ok. Thank you very much.
","Thank you sir.
",NA"So, please tell me what do you mean by independence of vectors?
","Independence of vectors.
",NA"Yes.
","Okay.
So, um.
",NA"Hey are you there?
I can't hear you.
Hello?
","Hello, sir.
I'm audible now.
",NA"You're audible now?
","Okay, sir.
So, sir, uh, can you repeat the question once again?
",Low"What do you mean by independence of vectors?
","Independence of vectors.
Independence of vectors as in the features in the in our data sets.
Vectors, they represent their relationships.
So, dependence or independence tells us about the relationships the features share.
So, when we talk of independence, like linearly independent, the vectors are linearly independent as in.
It can tell they are like a unique like, um.
Like, um, like the like the like the model can.
Like the relationships that the model tells the features have that is that is unique and accurate.
Like, um.
Yes sir, it's like that.
",Medium"Okay.
Does independence and orthogonality do independence and orthogonality mean the same thing?
","Independence and sir?
",NA"orthogonality.
","Okay, orthogonality.
Okay.
Do they mean the same?
Okay.
So, independence and orthogonality are.
They're not the same thing.
Like, um, when we have two variables like X and Y if they are independent.
Then the like one happens like occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.
That is how independence in independent vectors work.
And it when we come to orthogonality, when we have to vectors a and b, u and v. Uh, if they're orthogonal, their dot product is zero.
So, basically, they are at right angles.
So, uh, uh, uh, uh, pair of vectors, they're orthogonal.
If every pair in the set is orthogonal.
So, like independence and orthogonality are different because independence does not tell you about linear relationships.
Whereas orthogonality is like they are perpendicular to each other.
Um, like, um.
Like orthogonal vectors, they can always be linearly independent.
But the reverse of it is not necessarily the same in all the cases.
Like that.
",High"very good.
That's very good.
What is the difference between mean and median?
","Okay, with respect to, um, like a dataset like that, sir.Yes.
Okay, mean and variance, sir.

",LowMedian.,"Okay, median.
Okay.
Um, when we talk of median, like all the, um, all the rows.
Okay.
Okay, so mean as like, uh, you, uh, whatever entries you have, the distribution of it.
Um
",Lowyes?,"Hello, hello, sir.",NA"Yes.
","Are you listening to what I was telling you?
",NA"No, I didn't listen.
","Oh, the mean and again, I will tell, sir.
",NASure.,"Okay.
Um, whatever mean and median, okay, mean and median.
Okay.
So mean as like, uh, summing up all the values and dividing it by the number.
So, uh, the proper, uh, that is definition, but then mean, uh, and I'll actually then the median also.
Median is like, even though it is the middle value, but again, it's ascending and ascending order.
That we take and then the middle value.
And so the major difference that would come other than the definition would be, uh, with respect to the outliers.
Like a mean is very much sensitive to outliers when compared to median.
Like, uh, like mean is useful in certain situations like where all the values are very much relevant.
Like they, they have, they have a, they have something to do to the average of the values.
Like it's normally distribution, normal distribution.
Um, but when it comes to a median.
The median is not affected by outliers much.
So, uh, it is used in, uh, situations, uh, which has skew of the numbers, no, that is data science, one second, sir.
And it's like, it is used where, uh, the data set has outliers.
But then it doesn't affect much.
So it is a central tendency that is chosen in most of the scenarios.
Basically, um, yeah, normal distribution, we was mean a lot.
I think that's where the difference comes when we are using it.
",High"Right.
Thank you very much.
Good night.
","Okay, sorry for the network issues.
",NANo issues.,Okay sir.,NA"You explain overfitting to me.
","Sir, normally overfitting is in a scenario where the model lacks in data like the data provided to a model is less to make a proper prediction that might occur because of not using cross validation techniques or a weaker logic in model.
Like if the model's logic is not so proper, then it will require it will expect more data but the data if we which we have is limited then it will cause overfitting scenario.
",Medium"Very good.
What is the difference between cosine similarity and jaccard similarity?
","Sir, normally in cosine similarity we find like we point the what are the, like every object or every observation is marked as two vectors and we find the cosine angle between those two things.
And coming to jaccard similarity there with whole data set what we compare with things which are similar.
Like which are common in both we divide it with the total thing except the things which are not common in both.
",Medium"All right.
That is good.
So what is the impact of normalization on the model?
","Sir normalization plays a very important role because when we are dealing with very big numbers, the computational efficiency will be too high and so many computers won't be able to handle.
So when we normalize we get into a very optimal range where computation can be done fast.
This is one advantage of normalization second advantage of normalization is as we have discussed in class if we are dealing with if we are dealing with data set which depends on height and weight.
The height is a very small number when we compare it in feet like 5 or 6.
But weight is a very big number it will be at in the range of more than 50 like around 65, 70.
So in these places we don't want weight to dominate height.
So we accordingly we normalize the situation so that both play an equal role.
",High"Very good.Wonderful
That is very good answer.
","Thank you sir.
",NA"Can you tell me when we should use mean and when we should use median?
","Sir normally if we have a continuous data set like no imagine we can take this sir like now we are categorizing genders in class and in this case if I want to find the mid value and if there are exactly even number people like 10 boys and 10 girls I can't tell boy and a half or girl and a half because they are two different entities.
So if a new person comes and I want to assign them the mid value at these places like for categorical things I have to go for median and for continuous things I go for mean.
",Medium"Right.
Suppose the rank of a matrix is 0.
What can you tell about the matrix?
","Rank of matrix is 0 and since like all elements are 0.
",Low"Very good.
Suppose the rank of the matrix is not 0 but it is less than the minimum between the rows and columns.
","Sir, then that means one row is dependent on other.
So when we reduce it it gets cancelled out.
",Medium"Very good.
Now what can you tell about the determinant of this matrix?
","The determinant of this matrix will be 0.
",High"Very good.
Thank you very much.
","Thank you sir.
",NA"Good night.
","Good night sir.
",NA" Tell me what is the difference between mean squared error and mean absolute error?
","So mean absolute error is just the like different between the predicted value and the actual and then just mean by n. And whereas mean square and mean square will be like after like defining a difference with square and then find the find out the mean.
",Low"Very good.
Now suppose you have a RMSC value that is root mean square error.
Okay.
",Yes.,NA"And you have a MAE value.
Which one would be better?
And which one is larger number?
","What is the second term you told?
",NA"MAE mean absolute error.
","Okay.
Okay.
root mean square error or MAE mean absolute.
Mean absolute I guess because root is getting rooted and then again mean.

",LowSo you are saying RMSC will have a larger value is it?,"No, no, no, no, no, MAE
",NA"MAE will have a larger value.
Okay.
Is that always true or it depends on some certain situations?
","Root means square.
I would tell it is Root most of the times.
I mean not not really sure what that.
",Low"Okay.
Very good.
Can you name one classifier which is insensitive to data normalization?
That means whether you do normalization or doesn't do or you don't do it doesn't matter.
","That's min max classifier.
I mean the outliers still still stay insensitive to 
",Medium"What is a min max classifier?
","Sir min max classifier.
So it's mainly used to get the range of data to certain other range.
So for example, like if the range is between 100 to 200 and we want to get it to 10 to 20 min max classifier is used.
",Medium"Okay.
And why do we use this technique?
","I mean normalization technique or min max technique?
Which one?
",NA"Both of them.
","Okay.
We use normalization to for mainly two reasons.
First being like that if the numbers are one of the set of numbers is too large.
If the computer will have difficulty in computing and the second being like if there are two sets of attributes.
For example, one being like somewhere around one to in the range suppose one to 10 and other being two in range out in 2000.
So the higher one will have more weightage to the classifier in scenarios like distance and all.
So we do normalization.
Min max is one of the ways to get it down to that specific range so that the biasness does not come 
",High"Very good.
That is that is a very good answer.
Okay.
But I'm not sure about the accuracy.
You can check that.Now, what is the difference between precision and accuracy?

","Okay.
Accuracy is okay.
Let me just think right.
True positive.
True positive here and false positive.
The true positive here.
And the false positive here.
So I guess accuracy was true positive plus true negative by that all of them.
A total of all of them like true positive true negative false negative false positive.
So what it means is like the all of the truth proper to only correctly predicted by the total and precision was the amount of first one 
It properly predicted within the ones it predicted true.
So it's like true positive by true positive plus false positive.
So like all the positive predicted by the model and it will check how much actually is true among all the truly predicted.
",Medium\,"Precision because in accuracy what might happen is it's like something in general cases something which is which we are not concerned with that much.
If that gives a higher accuracy but for the you know like this thing we are actually concerned that might come low and then class imbalance affects accuracy a lot.
While in precision we can clearly see like how much proper it came in the ones it corrected as proper I mean it predicted as proper.
",Medium"Very good.
","Precision is a better thing to use.
",Medium"Thank you very much.

Yes sir.",LowYour rool no is 233?,Yes sir.,NATell me what is the Markov model?,"Markov model basically is a set of model where it predicts the sequence of chess but the next step only depends upon the current step and not the steps before the current step.
And it basically gives simple state transition sequences and explains in a simple way the transition from one state to another without much complexity.",HighAnd what is hidden here?,"Sir, hidden is part of Markov model but the difference between hidden and Markov is there and hidden.
Like the states are quite hidden and it is only predict and you know find a likely understanding of the hidden states based on the observed outputs.
So while the states are itself hidden from the normal user but the outputs or the data which it gives is observable.",MediumWhat are the different probabilities which are used for a hidden Markov model?,"Sir, transition probabilities one then emission probabilities one and initial state probabilities sir.",MediumWhat is initial state probability?,"Sir initial state probability in the sense normal probability of a given of a the initial state and how it goes towards the next state and you know gives the gives the observed output.
The initial state the initial probability taken for the chain.",LowWhat is normalization of data?,"So normalization of data is nothing but sir.
Sir, it reduces the it makes it makes the data more structured and makes it more structured coherent and which can be used.
It makes this data more structured and coherent that can be used will that can be used for the ML to predict the patterns and give a generated output.",Low"Okay.
Now what are normalization techniques which are available?","Sir, there are two normalization techniques one is minmax normalization technique and one is z score normalization techniques.",Minmax and z-score.,That is it yes sir.,NASo now tell me how does normalization affect your hidden Marko model?,"So basically sir hidden Marko model relies mostly upon probabilities and what happens is one state can generate more than one the probability when it goes to different states.
For example, sir this specific state which is hidden it can have probabilities it can have 
So and so, probabilities here and so and so, probabilities here and so and so, probabilities here.
But sometimes what happens is this becomes too complex and it can be very much difficult for the model to understand all this.
Therefore, normalization can be used here to reduce the in-coherent and unwanted paths and making more coherent and structured so that the hidden state Marko model can generate proper output and proper predicate out with based on probability.",Medium"Yeah, but how does normalization affect it?","Sir, basically sir, in these set of probability there are there is a probability which is more which is more towards the max and one is which is towards the min and so, through this max and min probabilities and we can actually predict which is a more coherent state which will be the successor of the current state.
But,",Medium"okay.
So, does it have an effect or it does not?","Sir, it does have an effect you are going to think but not that much of an effect because hidden Marko model mostly relies upon probabilities and whereas normalization as far as I know it gives more information related to the absolutes.",High"So, then why you are saying to limit to some extent?","Sir, I am quite unsure because if I be honest with you, so I am unsure with them right or wrong just my understanding.",Medium"Okay.
So, let us say you have built a hidden Markov model.",Yes sir.,NAHow would you know whether it is a good model or not?,"Sir, it depends upon the observable outputs and through observable outputs we can trace back to hidden states and using bound reach algorithm and with the algorithm we can trace we can use boundary algorithm to train the hidden model and get the predicted outputs for the specific current state.
And also if suppose using with the algorithm if you properly trace back the hidden states and if we generate and using a we say using the normal algorithm if we get specific and predicted outputs which together is equivalent to 1. Sir
Like for example, sir this is of course this has a probability x this has y and this has z.
If suppose xy plus y plus z is equal to 1 then we can accurately say that the hidden Markov model is proper.
Basically the accuracy should be equivalent to 1.",MediumYeah but how will you measure whether it is good or bad?,"Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Yes sir.
Sir.
Sir.
It is good.
So, it actually depends upon the training the parameters.
So, sometimes the parameters also have a huge hole in it and when we continuously retrive the parameters, so say, sir it is what do you call them?
Yes sir.
So, just one minute sir.
Yes sir.
Sir.
So, one of the method is you know getting the value.",LowWhat is that value?,"This one value, right term and yes sir.
Basically, so there is a function.
There is one concept wherein we are iterating the value function of each hm and through.
So, I am really not sure about this.
So, sorry for that.",LowNo problem,Yes sir,NAHow does dimensionality affect hmm?,"So, dimensionality.
So, basically what happens is that we are here the hmm.
Basically in hm since you know from current state to next state, all the possibilities what we take you know can be put into the transition matrix as well as emission matrix and while dimensionality we can reduce the number of states and you know make it to the most efficient states.",Medium"So, let me ask you the different way.",Yes sir.,NAYou said that hmm deals with three different probabilities.,Yes sir.,NAWhich of these probabilities are affected by dimensionality?,"Also mostly transition, mostly transition but to a certain extent also emission.",LowHow is transition affected by by dimensionality?,"So, that is right.
Yes sir.
So, basically sir the transition is nothing but it is a probability of of the of going to the next step from the current step.
So, that can be you know represented by a matrix called as transition matrix which determines the possibility.
It can be represented by transition matrix.
So, as I earlier said you know there are many there are many possibilities for one specific current state to go towards the next one like to a more more than one state.
So, many times what happens it becomes too complex and the model cannot work properly.
So, dimensionality comes into the picture in order to make it more simple and efficient.
That is what I believe sir.",Medium"Okay.
So, is it good or bad?","Sir, it is good because it makes it more efficient and simple.
So, that is what I say.
All the certain sometimes it can have a D it can have Dmerits because it makes a system way too you know simple which cannot accommodate for large complex problems at all.",Medium"Okay.
So, I am still confused are you saying it is good or bad?","Sir, it is mostly depending on situation but I would say if you ask my permission if you ask my opinion sir it is mostly good because it makes a system more simple and efficient.That is what",LowSo increase in dimensionality makes the system simple.,Yes sir.,NA"Okay.
And how?","Sir, basically dimensionality is nothing but it has been reducing the number of states.
So, what happens is there many unwant.
At times in HM there are many unwanted states that can you know hand pour the function of the specific model.
So, if dimensionality gets increased the number of many unwanted states can be reduced and you know the most efficient one can be retained.
That is what I belive sir.",LowHow do you reduce dimensionality?,"So, basically.
Sir, this is actually in this one I learnt in probability sir.
This is a matrix and you are you know reducing the rows and columns of work and then the other things are getting the dimensionality.
So, that is why I have compare correlated with transition matrix.
This is the row sir and you can reduce it and then you are suppose",LowHow would you reduce?,"there is a row operation.
Sir, row operation and often was suppose in the end matrix if there is suppose this row and this row are non zero whereas this row is zero then dimensionality is two is what type",LowI still didn't understand on how you reduce dimensionality?,"Sir, by row I column them operation.",Low"Sir, what row and column operation?","Yes sir.
No, I said I am can ensure related to this because what I have learnt is in probability where you are suppose to do perform row operation in order to reduce the you know the values in specific row which you chose and the same case for column as well.",MediumOkay.,"Yes sir.
Yes sir",NAHow did that course go for you?,"Sir, it went good sir.",NAAny feed back for me?,"Sir, it went good sir.
I want to you again come back.",HighThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA What have you prepared for your Viva?,"Sir, the whole mid sem and after mid sem and ensembeling models support vector machines, dimensionality reduction also.
",Medium"Okay, these ensemble models do the work for classification or regression.",Classifications sir.,Medium"So, they don't work for regression?",Classification and regression task. Both,Medium"Both they work.
Okay.
And this classification and regression task are the supervised learning or unsupervised learning?
","
Supervised learning.",HighWhy do we call them supervised learning?,"Because they are pre-trained by the data sets alike.
In case in clustering we need to match the relevant patterns.
So, in classification and regression both the classification will have we need to classify by groups and regression we need to obtain a value from particular object.
So, we call them as a supervised.
",Medium"So, you are saying in classification we put them into different groups?","
No, not classification.
In clustering we put them in pattern.",MediumIn classification we put them into categories.,"No, in classification by groups.
In classes wise.",Medium"What is the difference?
In one class you are putting them into groups.
In other class you are putting it into classes.
What is the difference?","
Not the groups are clustering itself is a pattern types.
That is not a pre-trained, not like pre-trained.
This classification will be like keeping one particular observation in particular.
So, keeping one in this.",Low"Okay.
Can you name one ensemble model?","
Bagging, sir.",HighBagging is an approach for training the model.,"
Random forest classifier in bagging.",High"
Random forest classifier in with bagging technology.
Okay.
What is bagging?","Sir, bagging is it reduces variance.
It trains multiple models.
For a...
It reduces variance, sir.
It trains multiple models for the subsets of a different data set.
Yes.
Different subsets of a particular data set.",Low"
Okay.
And what is the alternative approach to bagging?","
Boosting, sir.",HighAnd how is boosting different from bagging?,"Sir, it is like it reduces variance, sir.
It reduces... Bias.
And this one is... Bagging is a parallel approach in training model.
Boosting is a sequential training of a model.
Like correcting the errors from the previous one to the represent.",Medium"
Right.
So, now in random forest.
We have multiple trees.
Is that right?","
Multiple. Sorry sir",LowDecision trees.,"Multiple decision trees.
",High"
Can you explain what is random forest classifier?","Sir, set of observation.
I will explain you sir",Lowsure,"Okay.
Sir, random number generator between 0 and 1, sir.
In between 0 and 1, and we are taking two different data of observations, distance between them.
In between 0 and 1, it is random forest classifier.
",Low"Sorry, I don't think I understood.
Can you explain?","Sir.
Generally, random number generator between 0 and 1, sir.
So, these random numbers between these two different observations, the distance between them having these values, this is random forest classifier.
",Low"So, you are suggesting your... You have to give two observations for random for us to take a decision.
","Yes, sir.",NA"Then, when the random forest classifier takes a decision on the class level, for which observation it is deciding.
","Okay.
Between these two observations, we have like, both observation1 and observation2.
We are going to decide it.",Medium"So, when random forest classifier decides a class level for one observation or for all the observations, one time.
",For all the observations.,High"
So, let's say, let's take an example.
What is your project?","
Segmentation-free character.",High"character recognition.
All right.
Let's say you have one character image.
And then, you want to put it into identify what is the class level for it.
So, your suggestion is, random forest it cannot decide the class level for this character.
We have to give all the character patterns for it to decide which class they will have.
","
Then, it is not.",High"It is not like that.
Okay.
So, can you tell me, how do you know whether the random forest  model which has been built, is having any overfitting or not?","If the variance is large, then we can say that is overfitting also.",Medium"If the variance is large.
And what is variance?","The variance is ..
Should i explain .",Lowsure,"So, let's say, the variance is the same.
So, this test data is there no, sir.
Until when the training data is the error will be coming normally only but when it need to predict the value of an unknown parameter the error may increase
So, if the variance is lower and lower, then it is a regular fit.
",Medium"So, what is your x-axis and what is your y-axis?
",x-axis is the error ,Highand what is y-axis?,y-axis is the tester data that is representing test data.,High"test data.
Okay.
How do you fill missing values and data?
","Sir, there are two things, sir.
We can like, remove the rows.
But the other one is data imputation method, where we can do by central tendencies, that mean median and mode.
The mean is a sensitive to outliers.
Most cases, we will prefer median one, sir, because taking the average of that will be beneficial for filling those kind of thing.
And more, we cannot do this for more numerical data.",MediumCan you write the equation for entropy and explain the equation?,"Sir, the entropy is a degree of randomness or a uncertainty of an occurrence.
So, we can represent by this equation.",High"What is the p term?
What does it mean?
You do not know what is that, ",no sir,NA"
Okay.
How did the course go for you?",good sir.,NAAny feedback for me?,Excellent sir.,NA"Thank you very much.
So, roll number 234, ",yes sir.,NADid you have lunch?,"No sir, I had skipped.",NAWhy not?,"Sir, I was in a hurry, I have to take my medication.
I have to take my medication. for a few days I am not feeling well.",Medium"Okay, so why do you not take a lunch?","Sir, some friend called me and said the first event, you were so late, what are you doing?
Sir, don't mind me if I cough.",Medium"No, I am fine. So tell me what should I ask you?","Sir, up to clustering I am confident.",HighTell me what are the performance matrics for clustering?,"Sir, for clustering it is a silhouette coefficient.
And kelviss, Horbits and the other one is bolviss devinson.
These three coefficients we can use for the evaluation metrics for the clustering.",HighCan you tell me one problem scenario? One example problem situation where clustering can be used?,"Sir, for clustering since we are not doing it into already predefined classes, we can take the example like a mass number of people trying to visit a website like going into the internet, like what they are searching by seeing those recommendations, we can use cluster like these people are searching for these and these people searching for these like that.",MediumWhat are the different types of clustering?,"Sir, we have k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering.
So that is it, I know two of them.",HighWhat is the difference between them?,"Sir, for k-means clustering we are taking the k value which is a hyperparameter before they start itself.
It divides the data into k clusters and by calculating these centroids, it will continue iterations until there is no change between the data points of the previous iteration and the current iterations.
The hierarchical clustering uses the hierarchical clusters like it divides the clusters in a type of hierarchical manner.",HighWhat is complete link case?,"Complete link case.
Don’t know sir.",LowHow do we normalize data?,"So we can use mainly there are min-max normalization and we have Z-Score normalization and also we can use variance methods.
In Z-Score it uses the current value, min value and the variance standard deviation and min-max uses the ranges of the actual one and what it should scale down like a and b.
It will do the min-max and variance it uses main and variance and the current data item.",MediumHow do you handle categorical data?,"Sir, we can use categorical data, we can use mode or we can change the categorical data into by encoding itself.
We can use one hot encoding or we can use label encoding to change the categorical data into quantitatively.",MediumWhen should you use label encoding and one hot encoding?,"One hot encoding is like when you have to focus on single data items.
Like in a week, in a week, that is we have to consider whether it is a thursday or Friday.
We can assign one to the Thursday and everything will be remain zero sir.
But the label encoding we give different not matching but different such like Sunday 1, 1,  Monday 2, Tuesday 3 like that sir.",Medium"So when you encode that data, does it create any problem?","Sir, some problems like in suppose in label encoding, if the categorical data is very large, like if you take a week, it is only 7 sir.
But if you are taking like big good different unique numbers, it will create some inconsistency sir.
Like you will get the prefix of a different number, the model will get confused if it is whether the first number or the whole number like that.",MediumWhat is Navie bayes algorithm?,"Navie bayes algorithm, don't know sir.",HighWhat are the performance metrics you will work regression problem?,"Sir, for regression we can use sum square error, mean square error and road means square error.",HighCan you write the formula for mean square error?,"Sir, for some square error, it becomes some square error sir.
For mean square error, it is the mean of the some square error sir.
For root mean square error, it will be the road for the mean of some square error.",Low"What is the problem with this formula?
There is an error in the formula, can you find out?",Sigma.,NA"Any other problem with the formula in general?
I mean what could be a drawback of this formula?
Of this measure, not of the formula of this measure.","Sir, is it giving some time negative value sir?",MediumCan it give negative value?,"Sir, actually if you are squaring it, it will give wont give.",LowHow did the course go for you?,"Sir, it is a new experience sir, right
If in all other subjects it is like learning and writing sir, but it is this new hackathon and new experience.
Like how you will perform by knowing what you know and trying to implement new environments.
New experience.",MediumAny feedback for me?,"Sir, you are very good.",NAThank you very much.,Thank you. Sir,NA Where should I ask you questions from?,"I have some idea about KNN and SVM as well.
I was like knowledge about how I am in bagging and boosting works.
This is small knowledge.",Medium"So let's start small with small classifier called SVM.
Small name.
What is SVM?",Support vector machines.,NAWhat are support vectors?,"So basically what we do in SVM is like, and then what we want is the best fit of length.
So how we get it in SVM is we draw it to marginal planes based on support vectors.
And our aim here is to maximize the distance between marginal planes.
And that's how we classify using SVM.",Medium"Okay.
So what is margin?",Margin is a distance between two gutters or marginal planes.,High"Okay.
So it's large marginal good or small margin good?","Normally our aim is to increase the margins.
So our aim is to increase.
Maximize the margin.",MediumAnd why should we maximize the margin?,"So that we will have a proper best fit of in that case.
Because if we, it gives us a better idea on classifying those two.
I mean separating the two classes.
Let's say if we are considering only two classes here, then having a maximize the margin would help us class by easier.
I mean like if you look at the data points, if we have less margin, then it's not really a good way to say that, I mean there will be less precision if you look at it in that case.",MediumSo you are saying margin is related to precision?,"Not related to precision, sir.
I mean if I can draw.
Let's say data points are like this, sir.
So in two ways we can draw a margin like this in this way.
But here what we will be doing is, I mean in this case it's better to have a margin plane like this, compared to this.
So in that way if we see.",Medium"You are saying that it is better to have 
question is why?","Why?
No, sir.
I don't know, sir.",Low"Okay.
Can you use SVM for a multi-class scenario?","For multi-class scenario.
Yes, but we can use it.",MediumHow?,"I think we will be using kernel functions here, because it won't be linear at P use multi-classification.
So we will use kernel functions and take a, make it into a higher dimensional plane, so it will be easier to classify.",Medium"Okay.
How do you measure performance of a SVM which you have constructed?",I don't know.,NAWhat are the different metrics you can employ?,"For SVM, sir.",NAYes.,For a classifier?,NASVM is also a classifier.,"Okay.
Normally for classification metrics will be accuracy, precision recall and F1 score and R2 score.
Not R2, I mean F scores.",MediumWhat are the drawbacks of using accuracy?,"Like class and balance is one of the drawbacks, sir.
Because let's say there is a highly balanced class and a lowly balanced class.
And if, so here will be more looking towards high balance class when we do accuracy.
It's like even if we perform wrongly low balance class, it will still show high accuracy in that case.
So in that case, it won't work well or accuracy.",Medium"All right.
So if you have a class imbalance problem, what do you do?","Normally one of the methods could be using a smot maybe which generates a synthetic data with which has less classes.
I think that's one problem, one answer.",HighCan you write the formula for Naive bayes algorithm?,"I know a formula for the base class for the triangle.
This is base class.",HighSo how is it different from Naive bayes class?,"I mean, in Naive bayes we will be using this formula only, sir, but I didn't really go into how it works.",HighCan you tell me one classifier where sequentially it matters?,"You mean like multiple models running sequentially in that position?
I didn't understand by sequence.",MediumEvent sequence.,"Naive bayes
Naive bayes
Event sequence.",LowWhat is density based clustering?,I don't know.,NAHow do you get the most agglomerative clustering?,I didn't go through those two parts.,HighAny feedback from me?,"I mean could you ask a bit more on K&N or other parts
Because I didn't go through that last thing part.",High"No,
I already guessed what you know.
Okay.
And how much you have covered.
Okay.
So that part aside, any feedback from me on how I conducted the class and those kind of things, what I could get through?","I mean no sir, it was good strategy.",High"Okay.
And how did the course go for you?
Did you like it?","Yes sir, I liked it sir.",NAWhat did you like?,"I mean the first thing was that whenever you give examples, it will be easier for us to understand more about in which scenarios we can use models that part I liked sir and here.",HighThank you very much.,"Thank you sir.Sir, did I say anything wrong in my…",NA" No.
I mean you have missed studying some portions, left out something, but whatever you answered, you answered it fairly well.","Sir, may I have no other reason for this?
Why be maximum?",Medium"I can't tell you now.
Okay.
You can probably approach me after all I was over.
Okay.","Okay ,sir.",NA"Tell me, where should I ask you questions from?",Any Questions from premium sections maybe.,MediumYou have a choice to guide me otherwise I will ask from anywhere.,Okay sir K&N.,HighWhat is K&N?,"A K is the number of nearest neighbors we are choosing from the,
Based on the Euclidean distance or any distance measure we are using.
So, K is the number of closest values we are taking to the observation.
I mean, to the text test vector.",Medium"Okay, so is K&N a supervised learning model or unsupervised learning model?","Yes, supervised learning model.",High"Supervised learning model.
Good.
So, why do you say it is supervised?","Classification and regression models are supervised.
And also, we need to provide i mean the classification use to the model so that it understands how to classify them.",Medium"Okay.
So, but why is it called supervised?
What supervised and happens there?","To explain that, I will take the contrast with unsupervised model.",HighSure.,"So, clusters are a cluster in the…",LowYou can use pen and paper anytime if you want.,"So, clustering is unsupervised model.
So, in clustering, you do not need to specifically label that this is what this thing, this cluster is going to be and all that.
But in a supervised model, you need to tell that this is the expected value or this is the expected class",Medium"Very good.
So, is K hyper parameter or the parameter?",Hyper parameter.,High"For a K&N classifier, can you name any other hyper parameter?","Yeah, the distance measure we are using.",High"Distance measure is a hyper parameter.
How do you find out what is the right value of K?",We have to do hyper parameter tuning to understand the right value of K.,High"Yes, we can do that.
What is a class balance problem?",It is when the one class is having too many values associated with it.,High"And balance is there.
How do you overcome this imbalance problem?","We can use other tools like SMOTE to make artificial data to balance it.
I guess.",High"All right.
Okay.
You know what is normalization of data?","Normalization is when we are converting the, we are making the data so that it is fitting in some particular way.
So, that it is fitting in some particular range or we are basically trying to get the data into a particular range basically.",MediumAnd why do we do that?,"So, the data can be within any range like suppose we are taking in a K&N model, we are some data will be within 0 to 10 range, some data will be within 0 to 1 million range.
So, the data which has been in 0 to 1 million range will largely affect the classification even though it shouldn't sometimes.
So, we normalize the data so that it all fits in a particular range and is equally weighted in the making the final classification.",High"So, you said the data which has a larger range will affect it.",Yes.,NA"Okay.
How does it affect the model?","So, suppose we are taking the distance measure like Euclid and distance.
So, when it is in a small range, the distance which we distance difference which we get between two vectors which have large difference within that.
Suppose we are taking the marks of a screen.",MediumSure.,"Suppose the marks for one subject is from 0 to 10 but in another subject the teacher wanted to make it from 0 to 100.
And now we are trying to classify the grade of the student.
So, suppose this student has got 10 here and suppose two different students are there, one got 10 and one.
And here this person got some 10 and this person got 100.
Now, both of these are required to make the grade classification and equally are required.
But then the distance we are here, if we take a Manhattan distance here it will be 0.
We need some reference something.
So, suppose we say that 1 and 100 is A grade.
This is a hard example.
Okay.
But basically this will, when we have between 0 to 10 the maximum difference we can get is 10.
But over here the maximum difference we can get is 100.
So, the 100 is much greater than 10 know.
So, that will largely affect the final classification we make.
So, if we normalize it and make it all between 0 to 1 then we will have it such that these both equally affect the final outcome.",Medium"Very good.
Good explanation.
Can you tell me one classifier which is not affected by this?",Decision tree classifier.,HighHow do you constructed decision tree?,"So, initially we have a root node and based on the, we have some categorical values.
Now, we have a probability for getting each of these categorical values.
Now, we create the next node.
I mean for each of these categories there will be a branch.
And then after going here there will be the next set of another attribute and with categorical values.
So, those are taken into consideration to do the final classification and we create the next node such that it reduces the entropy in the system.",High"Yes.
And why do you think this is not affected by normalization of that?","Because every attribute will, suppose we are taking the age of a person and we will have to create bins to convert them into categorical values.
So, we can take from 0 to 30 and like that.
And then suppose we have something else like the salary.
So, we can take 0 to 1 lakh and so on we can create bins like that.
And all of this is happening and separates up to nodes.
So, it is not, they do not affect each other directly.",Medium"Right.
Okay.
How do you reduce the immensity of data?","We can use forward reduction, backward reduction, forward backward reduction.
Then there is principle component analysis and sharp line.
And then if we talk with respect to signals we can use FFT, DCP, wave-leapt, MFCC all these things.",High"Okay.
Is reducing damage already good or bad?","It is good because having an increased dimensionality will, so when we have, suppose we have one feature and we cover 90% of its the population data with the sample.
Then we will have 90% of the whole thing covered.
But then suppose we have two features such that they both cover 90% then we only have, they both, then we both only have 0.81 of the whole population data.
And then as we increase the dimensions and even though we have so much of data within each dimension, we will get lesser and lesser of the population data as the number of dimensions in.
So having more number of dimensions is likely to reduce the, how much the model gets to experience the population data.",Medium"Very good.
How did the course go for you?",I mean sir it was very good.,HighWhat was good about the course?,"I got an in-depth experience about each and every model I was only acting something more like we use Python and do like this and we will get the output.
But I was very happy to know that we were going in depth with everything.",HighWhat is your feedback for me?,"Sir, you are one of the best teachers I have had till now.",HighHow can I improve myself?,"Sir when I was revising yesterday I noticed that some parts of the, like sometimes when you are teaching you might end up jumping from one topic to another within the same lecture.
That time and I know right notes very sequentially.
So that time when you jump from one topic to another, sometimes there is a mismatch in the no-twitch lead to a mismatch in the understanding when I later go through the notes.",High"This is a wonderful feedback.
Can you help me point out some lectures or some portions where the top of my notes are?","Yes, sure.",NA"So that I, because that will basically help me understand where I jump.","Sir, I over here.
You initially started with cross validation right?
And then you went to Jackmine and then after that I got confused over the time.
So I was here, you initially started with cross validation right?
And then you went to Jackmine and then after that I got confused over the time.
And then after that I got confused over here like randomised search and research being used for cross validation.",High"Okay, that is an example.
I understand your confusion.
Any other place you have?",I think I have….,Low"That's okay.
You may not find it immediately, but maybe if you find it, maybe you can inform me during that project presentation.","Yes.
Okay.
Yes.",NA"Sometimes I mean I may think that this is all flowing smoothly, but for you it is a job.
I mean, that is a valid part.","
Yes.",NA"Okay.
Thank you.",Yes,NA" So, where should I ask you questions from?","Sir, decision tree.",HighIs decision tree a linear classifier or non-linear classifier?,"Sir, it is a linear classifier.",HighAnd why do you say that?,"Sir, as in linear, when we use linear classification, we are separating two different classes with a straight line.
So, we are splitting.
We are basically splitting out features here.
We are taking one feature and splitting it into a different part.
So, I say it is linear classification.",HighWe are taking a feature and we are splitting it into different parts.,"So, first we will take a feature which has more information again or which has less similarity based on that we split the features.",HighHow does it make it linear?,"So, basically we are having a line between two different features.
Like a same feature where you imagine if you take the data set of that playing tennis or not.
If you are splitting between sunny weather and rainy weather, we are having a split between the same feature in two different parts.
So, I can according to my theories, it will be long, I guess.",High"But that is one feature.
When you have multiple features, what happens?",We will classify based on the root node which we take as the root node.,HighHow do you identify the root node?,"So, we apply information again or we find out the gain index for that.
If it is less secure or the information gain is high, we consider it as to be a root node.",HighWhat is the information?,"Sir, it is a way or it is algorithm to find out the superior or the best node.
The best root node amongst all the features.",High"That is like a cyclic answer.
How do you find the best node using it for the first time?
What is the information here?
One that helps me identify the best.
That is a cyclic answer.
What is information?","I can identify the formula for this gain.
So, this is an entropy which you take upon the phrases.
We take the positive part first, p minus p plus is the positive part.
Then we take the negative part with log 4th sense.",MediumWhat is positive part for the negative part?,If we take an example like the tennis example.,MediumWhat is your project?,"Sir, hallucinations in LLM.",High"Why you are taking tennis example?
You take your project example.","But our data set is categorical data set.
Which one?
For the hallucination.",MediumHow your data set is categorical?,"It is in the numeric values.
We have vectorized it.",HighIf you have vectorized is it categorical?,"No, it is not categorical.",LowThen.,"We can have different possibilities of playing tennis on any day or on any day.
Based on the possibilities we take.",HighTo tennis.,Yes.,NA"That is the example you have practiced.
You have practiced how to write essay on cow.
You will bring it back to cow and write it.",No sir.,NA"Okay, go with your tennis example.
Even if I ask you to make football you will not agree.","After applying the split, we can consider this as the positive part and this as the negative part.
If we take entropy for this it will become minus of 3 by 6 log of…",Medium"So, what do you do if it is a character classifier?
Like digit classifications.",Oh digit classification.,Low"How many digits are there?
10, right?",Yes.,NA"So, if it is 10 digits to be classified.
What will be how in your formula?","Sir, we will have P of digit 1, P of digit 2, P of digit 3 until P of digit 9 from 0 to 9 with log value of it.",High"That is entropy.
What does it mean?","Sir, it means the randomness in the feature.
If we take it on a higher level, if we come back to the tennis example, it is the randomness of him going to get tennis on a particular day or not.
So, sir, if we have an entropy of 1, it is certainly it is fully random, it is uncharacterable.",High"If it is entropy of 1, it is fully random.","It is uncharacterable, sir.",NAAnd how does the probability depict that?,"Sir, the graph...",NA Another Y should the probability be a measure for that.,"It is classified, it has zeros and ones like a thickness, it is a true, if it is in place, fold.
So, if we are having binary classification there, so we can use the probability concept store.
We will use",MediumWhy?,"Sir, because entropy, it is between 0 to 1 or 0 to 100 as a percentage scale.
And if you see probability also lies between 0 to 1 or 0 to 100 in a percentage scale.
So, it is more relateble to it.",HighHow did that course go for you?,"Sir, if I say so, I am very bad at math and I am not sure, because my major interest lies in networks and other subjects.
So, this subject is little hard for me.",HighAnd any feedback for me?,"The teaching was great, sir.
The problem is like, for me math is always a problem and I never understood that.
That is a problem.",HighThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA241,Yes sir.,NA So please tell me what should I ask you?,"Can I ask some public's reports?
I can think I can answer anything.",Medium"Very good.
What is the difference between bagging and boosting?","We have multiple models and then we choose a subset of the training, data set and then we find a video of voting at the end to choose which model.
But in boosting we take one model, one output and then we send it to the another one.
Like the training data set based on the error we will calculate.
And then like we first, the grand number, some points from the origin data subset, not an endagistic subset.
Based on the error we will try to add change that, training data set for the next model in boosting.",MediumHow do you change that?,We calculate error like one minus log of one minus T by T total.,HighCan we explain it with a problem?,"Oh, it's like this.
We have or we have two times the same observation or something.
And then we get the, we give this to a model as this training data set.
We calculate the error.
Some error will come.
And then we calculate, for the next model based on this error, I will choose to remove or I will choose to add some training samples and then I go on training the.",MediumHow do you do that?,"For that.
I think for every component we calculate, things like this component factor of each.
Based on this, we choose to remove.",Medium"And if you do this, what happens?","You are trying to take the models, you are reducing the data set.
You are trying to find the data set, which is like the subset of the data set, which actually is required and then you do not take the ones which, you did not data set might be big.
So you can only take in the data points which are actually affecting your outcome",Low"So you will build one tree, take the error out of it and build the next tree like that.","Yeah, the stumps like that.",Medium"Right.
So now you have constructed the stumps.
So how will you, when you test it, how does it work?","For what?
Backing using the which one?",HighWhich algorithm are you explaining?,"boosting.
So for boosting, so for every stump, I can have a pedoclassion.",Medium"So you have constructed your stumps with boosting.
Now your stumps are ready.
You want to test it.
During testing, how do they work?","Because during testing, we take in, we again pass through all the models and then we get what would right.
Love, every time I am calculating error based on the testing data set, like you have a test sample, we test it on that, based on that we calculate the error.",LowAnd then which?,"This calculation is on the test set.
The model is trained on this subset and then you are calculating the error based on the test data.",MediumAre you?,I am not sure.,NA"Okay.
So let us say the models are created.
Now come back to the earlier question.
Model is created.
All the stumps are built.
So now you have one sample to test.
How will you decide the class level for this sample?
How will this test happen?","We on the last model in that boosting you test, you feed in the test sample and then try to ask you to predict.",MediumSo you are saying that you will take the test sample and feed it to the last model in the last dump created?,Yeah.,NA"So then you should have only the last dump, you should discard the rest.","Yeah.
For training we need all of them for testing I guess which can.
I am not sure about that.",Low"Okay.
Right.
So you have high dimensional data.",Yeah.,NAWhat are the challenges you face with it?,"High dimensional data, the challenges are the thing will be very sparse.
It will be like when you have high dimensional data points will be scattered everywhere.
But you have very less points but the dimensions are very huge.
So computing distance also will become a nuisance and then it will be very difficult to train models.
So mostly they employ dimension reduction techniques to do even get more efficient that you are world overfitting.",Medium"What are the different dimension, the reduction technique?","So first is when outright dropping some attributes or you do transformations, then you do feature selection.
You select the more attributes based on some methods whether most useful attributes you will take.
Yeah.",MediumSo first is you will throw your summary attribute.,"You can either really finally will select some.
Or the most important ones.",MediumHow do you find which one to be rejected or which one to be selected?,"Many ways are there most popular one I heard people use this PCA.
So you try to find the you first transform them into access where they are not orthogonal access.
And you find to find the dimensions which are having the highest influence on the variance which are contributing to the most of the variance.
And the most of the variance in the information or the variance of the information, most contribution to most of the variance you keep only them.
The one which are having less contribution the variance you remove them.",Low"Suppose I don't want to remove any influence on variance at all.
Okay.
Whether in this space or in that space I want the variance to stay intact.",Yeah.,NAWill I be able to reduce dimensionality within PCA?,"No, there will be a slight reduction.
It won't get 100% like you only only choose the one which has maximum effect on variance.",High"I want I don't want any variance reduction.
I want 100% to try.",Think you can't use to be something.,HighSure.,"No, if you drop some like if there are some companies that have no effect on the PCA I mean on the variance.
If you remove them, yeah, then maybe they want to affect.
But if there is some which has little but not more we remove them.
But there will be slight it won't if the only key to the comments have affect the variance.
You are removing the one which have little effect.
But yeah, so if you are removing the one which has little effect you won't get the 100% one.",MediumBut I want 100%.,I think you can't.,NA"That is a decision answer. Okay.
What do you understand by rank of the matrix?",Number of non zeroes or whatever.,LowHow do you find it?,We do….,NAWhat is the thing where you reduce both of them?,"But we do row reduction, column reduction, techniques and we reduce them like to a favor.
You have one on the diagonal matrix.
You do a row of matrix operation.
Row reduction, comment action, we get the only such that there is one in each.",MediumAll right. What is the lowest matrix you can have for a trending dataset?,"The lowest matrix.
The lowest rank.",Low"The rank.
Theoretically the lowest possible rank you can have for a trending dataset.",One.,NAWhat is the highest rank you can have?,"Number of rows, columns.
Number of columns.",Lowcolumns or rows.,"The rows.
Anything is fine.",Low"You have more columns you don't want that.
You want to reduce them but should not be.","No, it is not what you want.
Question is what is the maximum rank you can get for a rectangular matrix.",High"Suppose I have my trending data consists of 100 features. Okay.
And I have 10,000 observations.
So my rank of the matrix is going to be 10,000.
Okay.","Maybe 100 is more of a number of columns.
I think that sounds more appropriate.",High"Suppose I have 100 attributes.
But I have 65 observations.
Okay.
So the rank of matrix is going to be 100.
Okay.","There is no reduction then.
Well, rank is, uh, I don't know the exact formula of this is for rank.
I think we do row reduction and find number of rows.
I think it's number of rows.
Mostly.
I have a rows make sense.",MediumSo you will change your answer from number of rows to number of columns.,"I think it should be on number of rows.
But when you have here, in our scenario, we take features to be more appropriate as rank.
But in while doing matrix, we generally go with rows.",Medium"Okay.
So there is a upper limit to the rank.","Yeah, it should not like the number of columns.
Like the, if this is square, then it's both the same.",Low"Okay, let's say square matrix.
So the upper limit is the number of attributes.","Number of attributes.
Yeah.",High"It's a square matrix.
So attributes are the same.",Yeah.,NA"All right.
Suppose you have a rank less than that.
Like 100 features, 100 observations.
So your MM or NN is 100.
All right.
But you can rank up 85.
Okay.
Or 73.
Okay.
Or 37.
Okay.
What does it tell you?","That you have many data, many samples which are of similar samples, which don't teach the model anything new.
They would teach the same thing.",MediumAnything beyond?,"Like they don't bring in any new information from the population.
They have all that that sample has like 85 columns are having 85 unique it from the population.
These remaining are already included.
They don't teach anything new.",High"So you are saying if you employ a row reduction technique or column reduction technique, you will be able to represent the same information with 85 columns.","Yeah.
I think that's good.",NA"All right.
Good.
So.
And that is that without any loss of information.
Right.",Can't guarantee no loss.,High"Because you didn't do anything.
You were just doing manipulation of the vectors.","I think because if you're able to remove a column by row reduction and those two rows are essentially the same, I think you have a lot of loss we can put it.",HighSo yet you are able to reduce the number of features.,Number of rows.,NA"If rows get reduced, row reduction columns will reduce.","No columns have a attribute in us. So rows if I am able to reduce one row, that means it's the same as another one, just the coefficient is different.",High"So are you saying that if I am doing row reduction, I will get a different rank.
And if I do a column reduction, I will do it.","No, you will get the same.
My guess is same.",Medium"So.
So.
So your rank has reduced from 100 to 8.","Column reduction in our scenario, if you assume column as attribute is row, I think we don't do column reduction for rank.
Rank I think for row with samples where you have samples as rows.
That's the observation as rows.
It's more appropriate to find a rank with like that.
Keeping.",MediumWhy would it be more appropriate?,"I would like to remove a column because the rank is 85, we can't remove the other 25 columns.",Medium"You don't know which one is different columns.
But suppose instead of going with row reduction, I go with the column reduction.","Column reduction, that you can't do.",HighWhy I can't do?,This column is attribute for every observation.,High"Okay.
It's a matrix in a little lesson.",But that would make sense in our model.,High"What do you do?
See, when your rank is becoming 85, we will with column reduction will it have a different rank.
With column reduction.","You're saying column reduction.
Yeah, that does matter.
I saw.
Column reduction seems to be the way how you mind facing.
Column reduction and row reduction.",Medium"So which basically means there are 85 columns which are meaningful information.
Other 15 columns have become 0.",Yes.,NASo which means you are able to reduce your features?,"No, we don't take features as columns.
I would say columns as rows and features as rows.",Medium"Ok you take features as rows.
Then it won't make sense.
Okay, let's say, we can let's say, we are able to reduce the attributes. Did you lose any information?","Hmm.
Yeah.
Column reduction, we can't do well assuming columns as attributes.
It would change the entire data itself is what I think.
Because an attribute column in itself is suppose if your attributes are columns and rows, I think if you do column reduction, between two columns, it makes no sense.
You have to do between assuming that if you do row reduction, you are trying to remove observations which are same.
Just some coefficient of this algebraic data itself.
Is it the same or they might be linear combination of goods.
So why can't the columns be linear combination of goods?
No, that makes no sense.",Low"Why it doesn't make sense?
When you are doing PCA, what are you doing?
I am just bringing out linear combination of original space.","You can, yeah.
But here we can't remove just like that, we cannot remove based on column reduction.",HighYou have set up your mind not to do it.,It doesn't sound right,High"It doesn't sound right.
Now we are bringing in ethics into it. 
Okay.
Very good. How did the cores go up for you?","Was I correct?
Can we do column reduction?
Is it correct to do it?",High"I gave you an example of PCA, what does PCA do?","It removes based on the variance.
Based on the variance, you can not just remove.",High"When you are doing based on variance, you should project it into a linear space with a linear combination of original space.",You are projecting into a linear space.,High"So when you are projecting it into a linear space, when I am doing column reduction, what else am I doing?","Yes.
Right.
Somewhat, so clearly understood I will go find about it.",MediumHow did the cores go up for you?,"It was good.
It felt very nice.
Like, felt that worth paying 3 lakhs for this college after this course.
I might have not answered most of the questions here because I might not have prepared.
But yeah, I like the way how you teach.
Sir, and yeah, that is just, this is from PPT, UT, from your mind, you generate everything and you teach, it was very nice.
And yeah, felt after mid-sem it was very fast.
Well, it was very fast.
Still, mid-sem it was very nice.
Perceptural learning was like every day was properly understanding everything after that day.
It was going very fast.
Felt maybe not useful for our course, so you spread through it.",HighNo.,SVM was only one day.,NA"No, that was it.
It is not.","See, the permit said it was basically setting the context of bringing you up to speed.",NAAny feedback for me ,"Yeah.
It's good.
You are coming next semester to TC.",High"No, what else?","Like, we took neural networks as a vector, so I will go into TCM.
Okay.
I am on there.
Given one course, that is a bit.
Nice.",MediumCan I have a little feedback for me?,"Good sir, that's it",NAThank you very much.,Thank you sir,NA" So, what do you want me to ask you?","Sir, last iteration K N N algorithm.
Regression.
Logistic.",Medium"Logistic regression.
Please write the formula for logistic regression.","Sir, actually the last iteration, it will be like a sigma rst, so it contains 0.501.
So, it use here, it is like sigma, the formula is like 1 by 1 plus equal minus 6.
So, it is used to help to direct the cancer every if the patient have or not.
In linear regression we couldn't find, but here suppose if the range is between 0 to 0 5, like that if the data points like here.
So, based on this we can find it is 0, it is i is a, you have the arc, cancer or not, like that we can do.",Low"Okay.
So, for cancer yes or no you can do it.","Yeah, for.
Yeah.",NAWhat is your project?,"Sir, HMM.
Yes.
HMM, screen segmentation character is.",MediumHow many characters you are recording?,"Sir, like, malayali, I am sorry, malayali, I am not.",LowHow many different classes of characters are you recording?,"Like, our bag of features.
So, like that suppose if you reach each one we will divide into the suppose if this contains more votes and so on.
So, we will divide into each part and we will extract the votes from that.
Actually, Ma'am gave like first we have to find the English words, extract and then we will give Malia numbers.
And later off to that we got the results.
And later we changed to, it can 0.7.",MediumHow many different character classes are you dealing with?,Different character classes.,LowHow many different characters are you dealing with?,"So, it contains data set, I didn't check but it contains more.",LowMore means more.,"Sir, around, sir, I have problem in didn't check but it contains a lot of like, contains more than some, about 1000 select.",Low"Okay.
So, how do you use logistic regression there?","Here, sir, we have based on, actually for compared to the linear regression I did for lost regression here better sir but it is I do not know for this for lost regression.",Low"Okay.
What are the parameters in logistic regression and hyper parameters?","Sir.
Sir.
Okay.
So, wait a little bit.",LowWhat are the parameters and hyper parameters in logistic regression?,"Sir, I can add more.
here.
The Canon does not have armadas', but he has this, but only one thing is very.
Based on what the labeled later steroids reviewed trained surpasses, which is the existence is data based on the PVL do classification from this.",MediumWhat is the difference between regression and classification?,"Classification is used for like for categorical data and regression use for like continuous ones.
For example, if you take classification is like sub-evident with examples.
So, classification suppose just to be it is suppose it is cats or it is all the cat or dog it is present actually actually data and here it is we need to suppose it is cat is there based on the actual one we will predict whether it is cat or not in the classification like a can and so in regression means it will come into the linear regression it contains so based on it will be continuous data.
So, it contains suppose if you take it will be separate separate to categorical will be there but in regression it will be continuous function.
The output will be in like we will continue it will get like the discrete form here in no it will be in continuous",Medium"So, how do you measure the performance of regression?",Performance of linear regression like okay so like by using mean square of the object of the limit means.,MediumCan you write the formula for mean square?,"mean square.
Actually I prepared but I didn't remember",LowWhat is the problem with mean square error is a measure?,Means square?,LowWhat is the problem with mean square error is a measure?,"So, actually I should use to find the accuracy so problem means actually I know the advantage of this mean square error of two.
So, when the data set so to find out the better accuracy we use mean square.",Low"So, find out better accuracy?","No, to get better accuracy you use mean square error.",Medium"Means square error based on just we will check it will it contains accuracy or error?
How does accuracy is how do you get accuracy from mean square error?","So, no sir sorry if you calculate then we will get to R if the if the range is 0 to based on the values is 0 to 1 or it will check.
So, we will we will get the values are based on that we will do it is accurate one or not.
It will be it won't show the accuracy based on the what is the value get it will it will check.",LowOkay what is the evaluation of data?,Normalize mean max formula.,Medium"How do you do mean max formula?
Can you write the formula for mean max?","A B is something.
Exact, you know is not a forward something around is like this a forward.",LowOkay what are the challenges of using high dimensional data?,"Sir do you we cannot train levels of we are in the day features are more.
So, so we want suppose the features not only unimportant features all this so further we use we can use reduce the demo safety and we can train the deals.",LowHow can you reduce the events landlady?,I know that topics I have got here.,LowYou know that topic.,But you don't remember now.,NA"I do not remember 
your roll no. is 243",yes sir ,NA"Okay.
Thank you very much.",Thank you sir,NA So please tell me what all you have prepared.,"Sir before mid-sem I can answer everything most of the topics.
After mid-sem I am confident with support vector machine, IO basis, asapron and few of the topics we have been implemented in our projects are like Lyme shop analysis.",HighSo that is deal with the live base.,My live base sir.,HighSo the right the formula for live base algorithm.,Yes sir.,NASo tell me what are these terms?,"Like live basis actually like it is a observation to what will learnt probability or base theorem.
In this what it will see every feature is independent of the other feature.
Actually this won't happen in most of the real time scenarios.
Like for suppose let x be the feature in c data set and for that we are calculating the probability c of x by total data set into that feature.",Medium"So why is it called live base?
How is it different from base theorem?","Base theorem will do this is for predicting the next form of one distance.
I do not know that.",HighWhat is next fc?,"In machine learning through different like regression or anything we will use if we suppose we have a data set.
If we train a model even if we give from the data set or even if we give the new data set based on that it will predict the next output or else if the data set is the model is trained according to its training it will predict the new values.
Like in solution design we did to predicting gst in a sir.
Previous data of gst we give and it will predict the next next fc's.
That is how you can use this.
Not this one is mostly model machine learning models.",MediumWhat are how do you feel missing values in data?,"Sir we can do that in two types.
One is global value means we can fill all the missing values with one now or else we can use centroid energy sir.
Mean median and mode.
In this median is the most useful thing I think sir because why it is not sensitive to outliers.",High"Good.
Now suppose you have done filling of missing values with central tendencies.
How will it affect your neighbor's algorithm?","No.
If all the missing values are filled then it will predict more accurately more correctly.",High"You have the formula of neighbor's in front of you.
Now can you tell me how will this formula predict things better if you are filling missing values with the central tendencies?
Explain it please.","So first suppose if you select one feature and if in that feature any missing values are there that missing values you filled it no more sir.
So that it can this C value will be.",This is your formula for live base right ,sir,NA"So you are saying this will become better .
Where in the formula okay the factor of filling of missing values comes in so that that becomes better.",Any features in features will be,Lowwhers is it?,See particular feature if you select that in particular feature if you are missing values that missing values will be filled out.,MediumSo if it gets filled why would that become a better number?,"Value will change sir.
Probability will change.",MediumProbability will change.,Means P of C means,LowWill it change for good or bad?,For good cause change.,Mediumif it changes how we will predict?,"Like if it missing values we cannot predict there is still one sir.
Means median or mode will be mostly related to reminding data set only.
Outlier won't come in that sir.
That's why it will be good.",Medium"Very good.
How about normalization of data?",Normalization of data like we can do that using Z score or Min Max Formals.,HighWhen do you use which one?,"Z score will be used when you have a mean or standard deviation sir.
It will it will not clear the outliers completely but it will make sure that it will it has the same standard deviation and mean is also.
When it comes to Min Max Formal B of max minus B of Min will be that formula.
A i minus A min by A min minus A max into B min minus B max will do this sir.
This will that one and also plus B max will do that B max will take this two terms B min minus B max plus B max I do not remember but they will take care of this one sir.
Normalization of that two terms.",Low"Okay.
Right.
So normalization helps you to get better result in easy process sir.",Easy process will increase.,LowEasy process will increase.,Yes.,NA"Where in the formula will it in is the process?
Which part of the formula will become easy?",P of C will become is a part for real fee.,MediumWhat is P of C?,What are the features of probability,HighThat is P of C. And what is P of C given X?,Like that feature in whole dataset.,Medium"Okay.
What are the challenges of high-dimensional data?","There is a curse of dimensionality sir.
What will happen is if a dataset is prepared then the probability if we are including more features or more dimensions into it the probability we are predicting correct will less sir because if we put some hundred features and before that is only ten sir then we included other term.
For this ten features we got some accuracy values and also again if we include the ten extra this will we cannot tell that it is correct sir because more the dimensionality less the accuracy they are inversely proportional sir.
Curse of dimensionality.",Medium"So how do you reduce dimensionality?
How do you reduce this curses?","Curses.
What are some concepts in us are whether that is related to machine learning or not.
Some vector assembling we can do in us are a vector encoding.
Assembling of vectors.",MediumWhat does it mean?,If there are some useless datasets means not so needed datasets features in the dataset those two or three features can be combined by vector assembler.,HighHow?,For suppose we have done a project on big data analysis on predicting how hard structure that there are many features like is married or not these kind of things are not directly proportional to predicting hard structure that is how they know.,HighMarriage assume it is not.,"It may be a professional it may be depending but mostly we cannot or as place you are living rural or urban because now health facilities are everywhere not so rural or urban what you are living.
This kind of things we can try to how will you club that is my question.",Medium"How do you club, that is my question?",Like we can create we can put some brilliant type or like one some encoding we can do and ,Lowhow did the course go for you?,It went well sir mostly because you didn't even give ppts so we were forced to learn everything that means the theoretical knowledge is good sir and also hacathon also help for us.,HighAny feed back for me.,No sir you are fine sir.,NAThank you very much.,Thanks sir.,NADid you have lunch?,No sir,NAWhy no?,"I came for viva as usual.
I was there from 1:30 that is why.
",NA"
All right.
What have you prepared?
What should I ask you questions from?",KNN Classifications.,High"
KNN Classification",yes sir.,NAIs KNN a linear classifier or non-linear?,Linear.,HighWhy?,"Because based on the points like the K value we give, it will take the data points and then classifies it.",High"So how does that make it linear?
Yes, miss.
How does that make it linear?","When we want to find which class point or some object wants to belong to, like which class it belong in we find the distance and classify them . linearly we classify",High"
You classify them linearly. 
What do you mean by linearly?",no idea sir,NA"No idea ok
How do you fill missing values?","We can handle it by taking the mean or the medium by imputation.
We can fill the missing values.
We can use the term, the missing values, the drop the missing columns.
","Okay.
So how do you fill the missing values?","We can calculate the mean ,median.",Medium"
any one","Yes.
It depends on the type of data that we can calculate the mean.
",High"So boys mean, girls, medium, teachers are mode.","No, they are not.
If we are taking the average of all of them, we have to, for numerical values we take mean and medians.
for categorical we take mode.",High"Very good.
Good answer.
So for numerical, you can take mean or medium.
Any choice between them and why?
","We take mean and we want the data set to be in the same range.
We take mean and median  because median tells us the middle value.
So we can take the average.
",High"Okay.
What is normalization?","We can normalize.
So the scaled down the data points, the data set to bring it to a normal level, we do normalization.
",Medium"
So from abnormal level, you bring it to normal level.","When the value is too vast or too sparse, the data set is then we do normalization.",MediumHow does it affect KNN?,"When the data set is, we take the points and then we calculate the distance.
So if the point is 2, the distances have to be close for us to label the point of which category belongs to us.
So when we normalize the data, we have a clear point of which it can belong to.
The distances can be similar distances can be grouped.
",Medium"Right.
i didn't understand 
Maybe you need to explain with an example or something or some other way or maybe explain again.","If the data points are two large numbers, if they are large ones.
When we normalize them and calculate the distance, the distances will have only a little difference between them.
We will have a little difference.
Based on the K values, we take the closest points and then find the...",High"But you do even with normalized data, right?","But the difference might be too big no sir.
You either bring it to zero and range or minus one to one.",Medium"But when the difference is too big, it is too big across all samples, right?
",yes sir.,NA"So when the distance reduces, it reduces everywhere.
So how does it make a difference?","The distance is too big, there might also be a chance of noise or other qualities being involved in the point.",High"
What is noise?","It is like the data which is in the data, it makes overfitting, it causes overfitting.",LowWhat causes overfitting?,"When the training data, if the model is trained on a data, but then it is not performing as well on values, it is unknown only, which values it is not known if it doesn't give a right and ",Mediumthat is caused by noise.,When too many points are involved and too much features are maybe not.,Medium"
What is normalization what to do?",The only thing is to bring down the scale of the data.,HighSo it does not influence on KNN?,"
It has influence KNN.",Low"
How? at what","It might give more precise answers, more accuracy can seen.",Medium"
more accuracy will happen when you normalize the data.
Okay.
What about dimensionality?
How does dimensionality affect KNN?","And too many features are present.
We do dimensionality reduction to take only the needed features for us to classify which it will be to.
",HighHow do you reduce the dimensionality?,"By wrappers, filler methods.
We take the features which are needed in wrappers methods.
We only take the features which are needed for us and in the subset we take a subset of features and on that we change the way.
",High"Okay.
so you reduce the dimensionality.
What are the difficulties we face if we have high-dimensionality on data?
","for high dimensionality data.
It is too sparse that it has it.
So it doesn't give you the proper results.
There are too many features involved which does not give you what exactly the result or what is needed.
",Medium"Why?
too many features to each other and create a problem.","No, I don't know.
Too many features, they might point past noise or other, that training data, based on the training data only we can get results from the test data.
So because of too many features, the results on the test data might not be accurate.","I think your favorite of is noise.
Anyway, did I miss anything?
Which you prepare to tell and I didn't ask?
Whatever you prepared I asked.
How did you like the course?",It was nice.,NA"Nice.
What is your feedback for me?
How can I improve?","Nice.
Because it is classes different from every other classes or whatever subjects we had.
So it was nice to be in class.",Medium"
Thank you very much.",Thank you sir,NA246,Yes sir.,NA"Please tell me, where should I ask you questions from?",k means,MediumHow do you detect overfitting in k mean?,"If the K value is so small, it's like one",MediumHow will you detect overfitting in k means.,Like it performed well in training,MediumHow do you check that?,R2,Low"R2.
What is R2?",It used to measure relations between the dependent and the independent.,Medium"How?
Can you write the formula?",R2,Low"Okay.
That's how overfitting has happened in Knn and how they reduce it.","Like if we take more neighbors, we increase the number.",LowHow much more?,Like usually we can take n minus 1 K values like minus 1.,Low"What is N?
And what is minus 1?",Like N means the number of instance in the data like K values and minus 1.,Low"So what you are saying is that suppose our training that has 1000 instances, you will take K value of 999.","
Like that is the possible we can take.
The largest K value we can take.",MediumWhy not 1000?,We need to find distance between every point.,Low"So there are 1000 points, so I cant you find 1000 distances.",You can but it will be overfit.,MediumWhy?,Like you…,Low How it will become overfit?,Not overfit but we need to calculate every instance.,LowWe need to calculate every instance.,"The instance in the data set, so it will take more time.",Low"It will take more time.
Some strange reason you have, I am not able to understand.
Can you explain it a little better?",Okay.,NA"See you only have limited number of minutes.
You can keep quiet and pass the time.
I am happy.
Okay.
It becomes much easier.",NA,NA"Okay.
How do you feel missing values?",Like we can replace with mean median and mode.,LowCan you write the formula for mean?,Like some of the all by now.,LowAnd how do you find median?,"Like after ascending or after sorting, we take the middle values.
If there are two, we will find the mean for both and we will take the average of two.",Medium"Okay.
That is for mean and median.
Where will you use mean and where will you use median?",Don't know.,NA"Don't know.
Okay.
What is normalization of data?","Like we need to clean the data.
Replace all missing values.",Low"Replace the values in normalization.
Okay.
Can you write the formula for Euclidian distance?",Like for the long surface.,Low"In n-dimensional space, how will this formula look like?","Like I say.
And we will replace with the plus, the two minus eight one on z.",LowHow did the course go for you?,sir,NAHow did you find the course?,I didn't understand.,Low"You didn't understand

So is it a classification problem?","Yes sir, it is a classification problem.",NAWhy do you say it is a classification problem?,"Sir, we use HMM classifier like that.
And we also use KMM classifier.
But that is to give good hyper parameters for HMM classifier.",MediumGood hyper parameters for HMM classifier.,Yes sir.,NAHow?,We transition matrix and all V character effects.,LowHow with clustering your transition matrix you calculated and it helped you get hyper parameters better?,"I don't know sir, but I know that we use all those two.",Medium"Okay.
Can you tell me what is the difference between mean and median?","Yes sir.
Mean is average.
Some of all values by total number of values.
And median is the, if you arrange the values and ascending order and the middle values.",MediumWhat is the difference between them?,"Mean, if there are any outliers then it is better to use median sir.
If you use mean then the values might change.",MediumThe values will change towards what?,"Like towards outliers, if a very large value is there in that feature then it will go towards the outliers.",Medium"Good.
And how do you deal with missing values in that?","Either replacing it zeros or ones or like and check if there are any outliers, if there are any outliers we replace it with mean sir.
Also median or except mean.",MediumNow whenever when you are dealing with let's say that how in different ranges we implement the normalization of data.,Yes sir.,NAWhy do we do normalization?,"Sir if there are two features and like one is aged one is salary, like age is like 21, 22, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 is salary is one lakh ,2 lakh, well training the model.
This salary thing will be more, it will because the values are so large it will more contribute to the models.
So if he standardize, sorry normalize to all the values between some values then we can use it from 0 to 1 if he normalize.",LowCan you tell me one model which is not affected whether you normalize the data or do not do it?,I do not know.,NA"What happens to the probability, joint conditional probability of two events when the events are independent of each other.","Sir independent.
It will be 0.",LowAnd conditional probability will be 0.,"Yes sir,.",NAOkay so suppose I have two events so probability of A given B will be equal to 0 if I have to be I have to be independent of each other.,Yes sir.,NAwhat will happen to the joint probability.,"So I do not want to be there sir conditional probability will be P of A sir.
This one will be P of A.",MediumWhat are the encodings?,If there is any like a categorical data and if you want to change it to numerical then it is encodings.,MediumWhy do we do encoding?,"Like if the data is dependent on all the numerical values which are trained with the models.
So there are two types of one-heart and basically to change the data to numerical data.",MediumIs this needed for all kinds of models or for some models?,So every model not .,Low"Every model requires you to change categorical data to numerical data.
No model can deal with categorical data is this.",Yes sir.,NAAnd how do you find out which is the right model to be used in a given situation?,"By performance matrix.
If you find that accuracy and scores as this.
By finding performance matrix is very good.","What are the different matrix and performance matrix?
For a classification matrix.",Confusion matrix,HighCan we use the same matrix for regression also?,"
Regression has continuous values.",HighWhat are the performance matrix for regression?,Mean square errors have to be maintained.,High"What is the problem with root mean square error as a measure?
In what situation it can provide with misleading information?",If there are any outliers.,LowAnd what are the challenges we face when we have high dimensions on data?,"The model will train more.
We have to do that feature selection and feature effect.",Medium"That you will do.
What are the challenges we have if we have high dimensions?","The model will be trained so much.
So that it may give a wrong output.
If there are any features which contribute less to the model also.
If we use them like the model will give wrong predictions.",MediumWhy would you give wrong predictions?,"Mostly because of the features which are not.
It is not going to work mostly.",LowWhat is your overfitting?,"Overfitting is like if we see more number of clusters then it is all over.
We have to form more number of clusters.
If we give higher parameters more value then it is working.",LowHow do you find out whether there is a particular model?,"We will find the algorithm.
It is an optimal parameter.",MediumHow do the course go for you?,good sir.,NAAny feedback for me?,Everything is fine sir.,NA"Thank you very much.
247 right.","Yes,247.",NA Okay.,Good afternoon sir.,NA"So please tell me, where should I ask you questions from?",Maybe regression or entremal techniques?,HighWhat is your project?,Our project is code evaluation using weighted regression.,High"Yes, what regression techniques are you using?","As of now, we have used many regression techniques.
We used the normal linear regression.
We used random forest regression with XT boost, other boost and then we also used the sorry and lasso regressor also.
And another stacking regressor.
That's sure",Medium"very good.
So now please tell me, why your problem is a regression program?","Our problem is code like what our problem statement is given any code like we have to automate the process of evaluating that code and assigning a score to that code.
Like let's say we got C, C dataset.
So given any C dataset and the problem like we should be based on the prominent components of that code, we should be able to evaluate that code.
So this score lies in the range of 0 to 10.
It can be any value.
So because of this, it's a continuous, the output is a continuous variable.
So because of the it's our problem is a regression problem.",Medium"Good.
How does random forest regressor work?","In random forest, it's like it's a bagging technique like where we use us like we have multiple multiple weak, weak learner models.
So what we actually do is we given a dataset, we try to split our dataset into multiple parts and others, this does not mean like separate parts, there can be repetition also.
So we send few rows to they are like let's say we have multiple models, we send a few rows to few observations to the first model and then few more to second model like that.
We separate or we split our dataset and send to different models and then each with these models are weak learners and they each of them they give a output and then these outputs we take a average of all these.",Medium"Very good.
Very good.
Wonderful.
So how will you detect if they are overfitting in random forest regressor?","Detection is if the single erase height, there is a high error, then it becomes it becomes overfitting given training errors.
But internally it's all decision trees right so we can use the pruning techniques to avoid overfitting.",LowHow does pruning help in averting overfitting?,Like in general rather than splitting completely based on every feature and going in depth like we can fix the size of the tree or maybe limit the size of the tree to avoid overfitting.,HighHow does that limiting the size help in averting overfitting?,"Because when we are limiting the size we are not completely like trying to classify the given data.
We are not completely trying to like you know put it into into those notes.
Like in general when we don't have any restrictions we try to completely put the put our data into those notes and when new data comes it like it big because we are completely putting our data into those notes it becomes more comfortable and this causes it causes confusion when new data occurs.
So when we limit the size maybe we are not completely putting our data into notes.",MediumAnd that reduces overfitting?,Yes.,NA"I still don't understand how but if you are so confidently telling maybe it is right or what else I am so put to say.
Fine if there ever is overfitting by some means you explained which I mean to understand but let's say that okay that is what it is.
So you said that it is bagging right?",Yes sir.,NAWhat is the difference between bagging and boosting?,"In bagging we have these indip- as I mentioned weak learners right these are independent models.
So what happens in bagging is these models these weak learners they are all independent and we render splitter data we send them to these models but in case of boosting this is not like in bagging it is like parallel splitting of data and you know this training happens independently and the output is generally independently but this does not happen in boosting.
Boosting is like serial like we first we have a first we were going weak learners we give our data to this weak learner and then we update the weights such a manner that more prominence like more prominence is given to the observations that are not classified correctly and then this is passed the next weak learner and this continues like we keep giving this to another weak learner and weak learner overall when we combine it becomes a strong learner.",HighHow does this output of first weak learner go to the what do training of the next weak learner?,Before going it up we update the weights.,LowWhich weights?,Initially we give each observation some weights like every observation is given the weight and then first let's say we give them like initially all the weights are same let's say first we give one to one of our weak learners and then we try to like classify it we try to classify it and the classifications this all in training time the classifications which are wrong those weights are increased so that like the next weak learner knows that okay these are the ones that are to be given more prominence and the correctly classified ones those weights are reduced ,Mediumvery good what happened to the testing time how does normalization affect construction of decision trees or regression trees normalization,it does not it does not ,Low"very good 
why not ",normalization in general we like,LowDon't worry you are doing wonderful okay yes very good now just do little thinking and tell me.,Think from the point of view how trees gets constructed let's say whatever our class is like continuous variable we use a threshold to classify like it classifies into nodes right so because of this threshold even if it's an outlier it gets handled automatically or is it correct ,Highbut where is outlier coming in I didn't speak about outlier at all ,in general whatever or date or whatever type whatever range or data has like because we are just using a threshold to classify this group to group the data into two or more nodes further nodes because we are having this threshold so where there is no need of normalization.,MediumSo there is no need of normalization in says normalization doesn't affect I'm not saying you say normalization doesn't affect ,even even when we convert this data to our new range even then the threshold changes them and then the same thing happens the same in the same way we classify the data observation they go into same groups of same them and they go to same nodes ,Lowvery good I'm really impressed good thinking ,"Thank you, sir",NAhow do you define the course ,so good for me,MediumAny feedback for me,for me a bit dark color chalk if possible ,Highdark color chalk ?,like it's visible till middle benches but when we go to full last beyond benches it's a bit light like your all pretty they're also good just sometimes I face some difficulty you know to those numbers are on this one just chalk that's right,Mediumthank you very much,Thank you sir,NAthanks for the feedback,yes sir.,NA248 right,yes,NA" Okay, so which module you have prepared well?",Like a little bit about theory and some formula of Z score and a f1 score.,Medium"Okay, write the formula for a z score.",Yes sir.,NAWhat are these terms?,"Yea sir X is the values and U is the mean and U is the means and sigma is the lambda.
Sorry, sigma is the standard deviation.",LowStandard deviation for what?,For the values given.,MediumWhich values?,Data.,LowAnd what is X?,X is the values and we give some values that are mean data and U is the mean sir.,Medium"So, if you apply this formula, what will happen?",We can find the z score of the given data.,Highz score of the given data.,z scores.,LowWhat do you do with the z score?,"We can get that accurate value, one of the data fitting or.",Low"Okay.
Can you tell me why normalization is required?",To find the distance.,Low"To find the distance.
How does normalization help you find the distance?","Okay.
Not distance but .
There is a formula.",Low"Okay.
Okay.
How do you feel missing values?","We can calculate the mean sir.
We can calculate the mean.",LowWe can calculate the mean.,"We got the missing values in between them.
Missing values should be in between the one number and another number sir.
and add that number by divided by 2 we can get the one accurate value that the numbers should be between that number median",Mediumthere is a median what are the different data types which are available?,"like classifications like supervisor, unsupervised",Low" no, data types categorical data", continuous ,Lowcontinuous data," continuous categorical label, unlabeled leveled,",Low unlabeled what do you know about performance metric?,"like there is a four types of two positive, two negative, false positive, false negative by that we can calculate the confusion matrix and we can also find the f1 score to find the f1 score we have to calculate first precision and recall after that we can calculate the f1 score 2 into precision and recall by precision plus recall for that we have to first calculate the precision and recalls",Medium and how do you calculate precision and recall?,"
precision can be calculated by the true positive by true positive plus false positive this is precision and for recall we can calculate the true positive by true positive plus false negative ",Mediumcan you explain what is false negative?,"false negative it gives the data sir means it is false but you can easily tell that it is a first we have true positive true negative, false positive and false negative if the it is a true and it has a positive values but it is a true but it has a false negative values like that based upon first we have to consider that it is a positive or negative next we can see that it is a positive or a negative value like that",Low so are these performance metrics used for some type of models or every model can use this,some specific some models not ever not ever anything can use,Low can you name some models where you can use this performance metric?,to calculate the you can use KNN plus ,Lowwe can use it K&N plus ,K.N and classification,Low what do you know about clustering?,we have to train the model ,Low"So, to train model for doing what the model for doing what?","So, it what values predicted actual values and can get the predicted outputs.
We know some actual values with that we can take with that predicted values predicted outputs are getting same or not.",LowIn cluster.,Not in cluster sir.,HighIs cluster is supervised and unsupervised,Unsupervised,HighWhy?,"Because in supervised it has a labeled data.
In clustering in unsupervised it is not labeled.
That we can say that it is a supervised run supervised.
But if the data is a supervised run supervised we have to check with that data is labeled then it is a supervised.
If the data is not labeled then it is we can say that unsupervised.",Low"So, in clustering data is not labeled so unsupervised.","Clustering it is labeled.
Labelled means it can say that image name and data.",Medium"So, it is supervised or unsupervised.",Supervised.,High"It is supervised.
Then can you tell one unsupervised learning?
Give an example of unsupervised learning.","Continuous.
House-price.
Continuous.",LowCan you name one model which can do it?,HMM.,High"Okay.
You have any questions for me?",No sir.,NAHow did the course go for you?,"Yes, nice.
It will be a helpful.",MediumAny feedback for me?,"No sir.
We are glad you have to spend with you.",NA"Okay.
Thank you.",Yes sir.,NAWhich algorithm or clustering you prepared?,"So, k means.",LowCan you tell me where came in swap properly and where it doesn't work?,"So, when basically we use k-means in, so in the case of non-level data and everything.
When there is a non-level data, we use centroids, we take centroids, random centroids and use you-cleaner distance or monotone and calculate the clusters.
And map them according to their own clusters and everything.",High"Okay, but where does it work where it doesn't work?
It's my question.
You told me what is done in K-means?",Yes.,NA"That's good.
But tell me where it works, where it doesn't work.","So, you mean by real life application?",HighYes,"Yes sir.
If you take an e-commerce subset and something and there are products which need to be categorized into some parts.
If there is a seller, salary person and how much is spent.
And if you take this into consideration and draw a graph, if someone's salary is low and he buys more.
And if someone's salary is low, he buys less.
If the salary is high and he buys less, we can cluster them into categorized and give them this concert in real life.
How much percent of this concert we can give them",HighAnd that is an application scenario for clustering?,Yes sir.,NA"It is not application scenario for k means cluster.
Okay.
How do you measure the performance of a clustering algorithm?","Sir, C-Lot score.",NA"C-Lot score.
What does C-Lot score measure?","The basically it measures 1 minus half.
It gives how much accurate the model is.
The formula is like this 1 minus half, the sum of squares of this residual by total error.
The sum of total.",Medium"Okay.
Is that a good measure or bad measure?",I think I am confused.,NALet us say that a set is given to you.,Yes sir.,NA"And like you said, you have to do some clustering.",Yes sir.,NAWhat all things you will know before you get into clustering algorithm?,"We determined firstly the K value, sir.",Medium"First you will determine K value, okay?","Yes sir.
Then in K means we select K value and the random centroid.
The centroid should be not near.
Centroid should be farther away from each other.
If they are near, they will form a single cluster.
But single cluster will become a cluster.",HighOkay.,So we should take them farther away.,MediumOkay.,That is what.,Low"Any pre-processing steps you will take.
Will you check for missing values?","Oh, that comes under data class.
Yes sir.
We take for missing values and replace them with mean or median algorithm.",High"Suppose you replace them with mean or median.
How will it affect your clustering algorithm?","Sir, if outliers are there, the mean, if you take mean it will be higher, sir.
The missing values will be higher.
So we need to take a median in that case.
If there are no outliers in that one we can use mean.
So it will predict our its value in between it will be coming.
So the cluster will be gone.",Medium"That is about how to replace.
How to replace missing values?
You answered how to replace missing values.",Yes sir.,NA"Question is, when you replace missing values with appropriate values?
How will it affect your clustering?",it wont affect at this.,Medium"it wont affect at this.
Okay.
How do you calculate accuracy of a classifier?",NA,NA"Can you write what is, you know what is cosine similarity?","Yes sir, dot product by magnitude of cosine.",HighCan you write the formula.,Yes sir.,NAWhat is there dot v?,So dot product of the two vectors.,LowHow do you find that?,"Multiplying the values with that one and placing them.
If a1 x and b1 y is there and a2 x v2 y is there a1 x2 y is there a2 here.",Medium"Okay.
What does it tell you?
The cosine similarity value?","Yes, this one tells accuracy.",NAAccuracy?,"I mean, the cosine similarity, if you take a cluster after pointing the value, the cosine similarity will be lesser.
Between two points which are in the same cluster, many compare it to other cluster.",MediumSure,Yes sir.,NAHow did the course go for you?,It was okay.,NAAnd if any feedback for my improvement?,No,NAThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NAOkay so please tell me what I should ask you?,"Sir, mid sem portion",LowWhat is mid sem portion,"Regression,information.",LowOkay tell me how KNN is used for regression?,"In KNN we can take the value for KNN equal to 1, 2, 3 then we are clusterin in the similar class and we will be same, then.",Medium,,"And I thought you are telling something so I am waiting .You are talking about KNN, then clustering.
Where I am asking about regression?",No,NA"Don't get tense, think and give answer.",Sir,NA"what is KNN?
Okay, you tell me what is K in KNN?","We can take the value for if some data set is there, so we can take K call to 1, 2, 3 and then we can do that.","What is it?
You can take any value, correct.
What is it?","Based on our data set something else would be given, then we can calculate the euclidean distance or.",Is that a parameter or a hyper parameter?,Parameter.,NAWhat is a parameter?,"It is a parameter, it is a parameter, if we take it.",LowHmm?,No sir.,NASorry?,I do not know parameter.,LowYou know what is hyper parameter?,"Parameter it means that with x and y axis we can take and then it is called.
No, sir.
Y, Y, X, S, S, S, S, then it becomes parameter.
Y, Y, X, X, X, then. Y=M,X plus C",,,,,,,"Y equal to M, X, plus C, so which is parameter which is hyper parameter?","Yeah, M is the slope and C is the constant and X is the independent variable and Y is the independent variable.
Based on X we can predict the value of Y.",,,What is this called as?,"This is Y, C, linear regression, Y equal to M, X, plus C."," So, in linear regression which you are doing, now in the equation which you gave, what is parameter?
What is hyper parameter?","Hyper parameter.
Y is hyper parameter. ",Medium,,"and X is parameter? Hmm.
What are the performance matrix for regression?","And this is a confusion matrix and then we are going to take recall, precisions and value one matrix with true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative, then we can take that from their precision and recall our scores.
F1 score.","Yes, score.
How do you calculate the  F score for regression?","For the formula is like a precision into recall by two into, precision into recall, by two into, precision into recall by two into precision to recall.","Okay, what is precision?",Precision means that true positive by true positive plus false positive.,Can you calculate this for a regression problem?,"Yes, no.",Low"So, then how will you calculate the  F score for regression?",Oh no I cant.,Low"How will you calculate the  F score for regression?
What can you calculate for regression problem?","For the linear regression, I can calculate the slope, slope, no.
If some value is taken like that, then I have to calculate this.",Low"Tell me, what do you understand when I said two vectors are independent of each other?","Two vectors are like not in example, in regression, we can tell that one, we can predict the value of y, predict the value of y, for putting the value of x, x is the independent, and y is the independent, but for into independent vectors like two vectors are not dependent like.",LowHow will you find out if they are dependent or independent?,"In matrix, we can find out eigenvalue, eigenvector independent or not.",Medium"If the vectors are independent, what will happen to the eigenvalues?",Eigenvalues are zero.,HighAll of them?,"Yes.
Not all some values will be zero.
We can take a matrix wise and then we can find the value then if the mean.",HighHow did that course go for you?,I can't express how all are like mis matchng.,LowWhat are your tensed?,"It will be a part that I can write, but normally I can't.","In 9 months interviews stat.

Any feedback for me?","
I can't be answering anything like this one.",NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This also you can answer.
How can I improve myself?","No, no.
You are good already.",NA"But also you can't answer.
Okay, fine.
Thank you very much.
Two-fifth to two.",Thank you sir.,NA," Scary reaction,",NAsorry.,Scary reaction you sent out.,NAWhat's that?,Whatsapp,NA"Yeah, so what have you prepared there?",Support vector machine.,High"Support vector.
What are support vectors?","Support vectors are those HK vectors on which your margin lies.
Your gutters lie for the hyperparameters.",MediumWhat is margin?,Margin is the distance between the gutter and hyper claim.,HighOkay.,"There are two types.
Soft margin, hard margin.
Soft margin will allow for slight misclassification because there is no set of ideal rate on this world.
You need soft margin over a hard margin because, like I said, there is no proper data set.
There will be some sort of misclassification overlapping all of that.
So you would want to stick with a soft margin.",High"Margin is the distance you set, right?",Yes sir.,NAIs it good to have a large margin or small margin?,"Large margin.
Your idea is to maximize the margin.",HighWhy?,So that you have clear classification between the groups or the clusters.,High"How does a margin, large margin, bring the more clear?","Because the distance between the hyperplane and your gutter increases.
So the width of the street increases.
It's called a wide street approach.
So the width of the street has it increases.
So the distance between the two classifications increases.
So you have an ideal case scenario.",Medium"Yeah, but how does that wide street help you?
Because anyway your classes are lying outside the street.
So whether you have a narrow street or wide street, why should it matter?","Nice.
Interesting.
So the idea is that when there is a point x, you want that projection on the unit vector.
Whenever you get that, you want it either greater than 1 or less than minus 1 to classify.
Now there is that gray zone of minus 1 to 1, correct
That's the street of yours.
So in that street, there is that error margin.
After that, you want, so I am assuming that separation allows you for better classification.
The wider they are, the clearer you can be that these are two separate classes.",High"Your answer is right.
Question is why justification i need.",Why?,Low"That's where your understanding comes out otherwise.
It's just remembering something.","No, I put some effort into this.
SVM, I put some effort into it.",Low"I happy.
Now you explain.","Hmm.
I mean, sir, if you are classifying that the idea is to have two separate clusters.
The further apart they are from each other, the better it is.
Because there is lesser entanglement.",High"No entanglement.
If there is entanglement, then there is no separation.","That's the idea.
I understand what you are saying, but I don't exactly know how to...
I just know that you are supposed to maximize the width.
Why is because you want to have clear classification",Medium"Does it have anything to do with generalization?
generalization or not?","No, I put some effort into this.
SVM, I put some effort into it.",Low"fine.
Okay.
So tell me whether SVM works on the principle of similarity metric or a distance metric.","distance metrics.
Because the kernel function that you use uses Euclidean distance.
Yeah, I mean, it depends on which one you are using.
So if you use the polynomial one, there is one more red, RBF or something.
I am not sure.
I don't know.
The other one uses Euclidean distance.
That much I know.",Medium"Can you write the equation for the SVM for a test class?
How to identify what is the class?","Write the equation how to?
This is…",Low mue prime is equal to some of something.,"W dot x, plus V is greater than equal to 1.",High"That is not how you determine the test class.
That is how you determine the... That is basically a starting point for you to arrive at the equation which will give you the test class.",Correct.,NA"What are the equation for test class?
Even in this scenario, where is distance?","Where is distance?
This dot product.",NAThis dot product is distance value.,"The dot product tells you how far it is.
So I will tell you.
So your W and your x, so x is your unknown.
Your W is your unit vector in that direction.
So W is that distance to the positive sample or negative sample.
You will have one sample each, right
That is your support vector.
That sample is your point.
So the distance that vector W is the... Uska projection you are taking and then that you are getting as a...",MediumW is the projection vector of the plane hyperplane.,"Of hyperplane or that class.
Positive sample class or negative sample distance?
So that is next.",High"It is separating hyperplanes.

How?","How?
How?
I don't know, but I did read up on this question.
I knew the answer.

Mike. may be",HighThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA"Okay, what are we prepared?",Everything.,NAEverything you are prepared?,"Yes, I think so",NAYou have a preference for anything.,Maybe clustering.,NAclustering?,"Yes, dimensionality, reduction.",NA"Okay.
Can you describe the process of Db scan?",Of?,Low"Db scan?
clustering?",Db like index?,Low"Db scan is a cluster algorithm, right?
How is it done?
Any way to explain?","Db and...
Okay, I don't find.",LowYou know what a single linkage and complex linkage is?,"Single linkage and complex linkage.
Within clusters.",Low"Okay, what do you know about clustering?","It's a supervised classification algorithm, like technique.
Usually, like, when we want to form separate groups of data points, which are well-separated and like from each other and have less separation between the data points.",Medium"Okay.
And how do you measure it, clustering, compactness?","That are law firmance metrics, right?
We can use our CH index, Db index, or silo head, cello head coefficient.
So cello head coefficient is like between 0 to 1, it can take any value and it's the summation of the distances, okay, other distances.The distances have from the nearest neighbor, like the summation of all data points.
The distance between that data point and the data point of the nearest neighbor in cluster.
The summation of all those values minus the summation of the values of the distances of the data point and the distance between one data point and the other data points within the same cluster.",Medium"Okay.
So how does dimensionality affect clustering?","Dimensionality affect clustering.
If there is a high dimensionality, it will be difficult to form many clusters because usually there is data sparsity.
So there will be like too many combinations of data and not enough data to represent each cluster.
So there may be too many small or too many clusters which are not having like enough data points.",High"Okay.
So now please tell me, what do you know about normalization of data?","Normalization of data.
Usually we use it when we want to reduce or reduce the impact of outliers on data.",MediumHow do you reduce the impact of outliers by normalizing?,"So when we are using normalization, we usually bring all the values within a certain range.
So when it is written like a smaller range like between 0 to 1 or 0 to 10, then the impact like if the values are all in thousands and one certain values and millions or something by bringing it down to like a certain range, we can reduce the impact.",LowSo an outlier will vanish to become outlier if you just reduce the range?,The effect it has on the model will be less.,HighSo what effect does non-normalized data have on the algorithm?,If for in terms of clustering or just in general.,MediumAny model.,"In general, sometimes the issue can be like if all my values generally most of my values are in ones, two, but then there is one huge value.
So if you have a value like 200 or something, then when you are calculating mean of the data or something like those kind of values will get heavily skewed because of one or 2 outlaiers.",MediumAnd what are the normalization algorithms you know?,"Z-score normalization, min-max normalization.",HighWhat is the difference between these two?,"Min-max normalization is used to like when we use min-max normalization, we can decide a define a certain range within which like all the values will lie.
So if I have a range let's say 0 to 5, my lowest value of that data will become 0 and the highest value will become 5.
When I use Z-score normalization, it's more relative to the data.
We use it with like we try to bring it closer to the mean.
So the formula will be the data point minus the mean divided by standard deviation.
So when we do that, we won't define a certain range.
The range of the values will be decided by the mean and standard deviation.",LowBut is there some way you consider for this kind of data you should use this normalization or anything can be used anywhere?,I guess it depends on if you already have a certain range within which you want all your values or Z-score will bring your values more towards like it will scale the values in such a way that the variance is reduced like between the data points.,LowWhat becomes of the variance after the Z score normalization?,"Variance will reduce because now all the values are closer.
Basically we are finding like reducing or giving the values data, like the data points values based on their distance from the mean.
So by doing it that way like we are reducing the values how do I put it?
So if we have some data like 100, 100, 100, 120 till 150 and 125 is the mean then the data will become closer to something around like 10, 11, 12, something like that",LowHow did the course go for you?,it was good sir.,NAAny feedback for me?,good sir.,NAThank you very much.,Thank you sir.,NA"Okay, what ever prepared for viva?","So before meeting after meeting, some people like S.V.M.
S.V.M.",Low"Okay, what are support vectors?","It is a tool for both classification and regression.
It is the output based on what we are giving the input.
Mainly, we are using for the sentiment analysis, the application one of which is sentiment analysis.

So, what is margin?",No idea sir. No idea,NA"Okay.
Can you use S.V.M.
for multi-class scenario?",No idea sir. No idea,NAWhat assumptions are made when we use neighbor based algorithm?,"The neighbor is the same based algorithm.
We have to find a given feature.

Is that the only difference?
Where it is used or there are some rules?",Only the application.,NA"Only the application difference.
What is the difference between recognition and classification?","Sir, first classification sir it will give classified data.
Example like labels.
It will give the yes or no.
where as regression.
It will give the predict of the outputs.
Example is the height and weight of the person.",MediumCan I have regression if my output variable is categorical?,Yes.,NA"Like your grades.
My output is the grade.
Can I use regression?",Yes.,NAWhat are the challenges we face when we use high-diving standard data?,"We can't get the predicted outputs.
We use the high-diving.",MediumWhy?,means the da set will be more.,Medium"So, how should that affect output generalization?
How do you reduce damagenality?","We have to use the tokenization.
Suppose the data set contains the Boltzmann.
So, we can reduce by using the tokenization.",Medium"How do you find out if the vectors are independent of each other or not?
How do you find if the vectors are independent or not?","We can use the probability of the variables.
Suppose the probability of the variables is not equal to 0 means it will be 0",High"If the  a equal zero they are independent, the variables are independent.How did the cource go for you?",it goes well sir.,NAAny feedback for me?,"Obviously, but to mainly report the hackathon sir, the way you conducted this very nice, very detailed.
For example, all students have their good skills in actions.
Some students have good skill in them, but the maximum is the first time they have good skill in them.

Thank you very much.","Thank you very much.
220.",NAWhat is your Project?,"My project is like continuing learning from Telugu English translation.
Like we will apply elastic weight consolidation method to overcome catastrophic forgetting.",MediumWhat are the different metrics you use for such a project?,"Some of the references where I saw they used accuracy itself.
But as is sector set model for machine translation, I have used blusco as a metric.",HighWhy did you not use accuracy?,"Accuracy.
Actually we still do not evaluate the EDWC thing.
We only evaluated the machine translation.",Medium"Given that.
Can you use accuracy?",Yes sir.,NAhow?,"Basically what we do is, elastic weight consolidation, if there is a task key and task key, it will take some parameters in this task key.
And then it will form a metric.
In a matrix it will store those important parameters and by training task key, if it is like more important for task key, it will not change that parameter.
If it is more important for task key, it will change accordingly to the task key.
So like this, to evaluate this we can use accuracy.",HighBut in your problem can you use accuracy?,"No sir, I cannot use.",NAWhy you cannot use accuracy?,Not sure sir.,NA"Okay.
What is normalization of data?","If there is a VOSF and numerical data, to getting to a standard range, so that the model can train easily.",HighHow does the model train easily if we normalize?,No Idea.,NA"Okay.
Which model do you know?",SVM or clustering?,HighWhat are support vectors?,"Support vectors.
To find the optimal hyperplane, we see that the margin is maximum between these support vectors.
So there are the nearest data points to the hyperplane.",MediumWhy should the margin be maximum?,"Well, to test on this data, if you don't want any confusion like for efficient classification, we want to ge",Lowhow maximum margin ensure efficient classification?,"Maximum margin, we see that no data points are between in the range of margin.
So if there are data points, the model gets confused, it is that class or this class.",Low"But how does margin help there?
How does it help in reducing confusion, etc?","It was in confusion.
I mean, I'm not able to think right now.",Low"Why?
Am I asking difficult questions?
Am I asking two simple questions for which you are not prepared?
Then why are you nervous?",So the next question sir...,NAYou tell me what question should I ask?,Anything in  regression.,NAYou ask a question in regression.,"What are the metrics used for regression?
That is very easy.",HighOk answer it.,"The root main square at the root absolute main square, RMS and R square.",HighSo can you write the formula for RMS?,Root mean Square.,LowHow did that work go up for you?,"I mean, I understood most of the concept in class itself, except for the concepts which I'm absent.",HighAny feedback for me?,"Feedback, you explained very good sir.
I am only attentive in your class sir.",MediumAnything I can improve?,I am sorry sir nothing.,NAThank you very much.,Thank you.,NA"Yes, Mr. Santos Kumar, please tell me what is the difference between regression and classification?","The equation is the thing which we will predict the new thing, which is not there in the  predict sir.",LowYou are creating new things in regression?,"Not new things, then we predict something.
We know what we are predicting and we know what we are doing.",MediumAnd in classification?,"Classification also, it is also a supervisor only, sir.
But...",Low"We are predicting old things, only.",No sir,NAThen?,"That also we are training and testing, sir.",Low"Training and testing, okay.","In regression we will do mean square error, absolute error and error.

We have to predict, sir.",Low"No, 123 are there.
The predicted values are 456.
Okay.",Okay sir.,NA"What is the mean square error?
Three values are available, one, two and three.
One is predicted as four, two is predicted as five, three is predicted as six.
So what is the mean square error?
I am not asking for the formula, I am asking you to calculate.",Around 120 sir,Lowone twenty hundred and twenty okey. ,yes.,NAWhat is mean max normalization?,"To control out layers, to remove the out layers and we will use mean max, mean max.",MediumWhat do you do in mean max normalization?,"Min Max normalization.
Basically, we will take all values to under ones and we will normalize.",Medium456 can you normalize between 0 to 1?,"0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6, 0.5.",Low"Okay.
How do you reduce dimensionality?
What are the problems with having high dimensional data?","Model may not fit.
We cannot get any crisis reasons.",MediumWhy?,Due to the training error and testing error.Due to the high dimensional data.,LowSo you will have more training error due to high dimensional data?,No sir testing.,NA"You will have more testing error due to high dimensional data.
How?
How does dimensionality affect either your training error or testing error?",we won't get the correct accuracy.,High"We will not get correct accuracy.
How do we get correct accuracy?",relavent accuracy sir.,NAHow do we construct a decision tree?,decision tree….,NA How did the course go for you?,Good sir.,NAWhat was good about the office?,"Learning models sir, mostly learned about classification and regression.",HighYou have any feedback for me?,"Everything is good.
More examples you gave me real life examples.
Good sir.",MediumThank you very much.,Thank you.,NA What are we prepared?,You can choose the topics and I am not find with any topic.,MediumWhat is your project?,A project is our legal predictions outcome.,MediumWhat kind of problem this is?,Do you mean what problem is in the project or you want me to explain what the problem about ,MediumWhat kind of algorithms can you use for this problem?,It's a classification problem.,HighWhy do you say it is a classification problem?,"Because our target values, whatever our judgment values are all 0,1,2,3,4, I mean 0,1,2,3,4 types.",Low"Okay.
So how do you solve this problem?","Initially we had started planning with our basic classification algorithms, using KNN on this.
So the first thing what we have done in our data set is we were having 768 columns and 600 rows.
Which is by looking at the data set we can tell that it will clearly whatever model we train, it will clearly have an overfitting scenario.
So first we have basically scaled down or normalized R model and then applied PCA on that.
The PCA basically and we removed all the co-related rows, if there is a co-relation between two columns, something we removed the co-relation and we just kept one column to reduce the rows.
We had first got it down to 300 and now to 175 columns.
So even though 175 is way too much higher for the data set, like if we have 10 attributes and each attribute having two values, we of course it have two part 10 rows to fit a model properly.
So still we were liking rows.
Then we started instead of base models, we were trying to do ensemble model and then we went to stacking.
One best stacking model which gave us a good accuracy was, here I am talking about accuracy because the class balances somewhere around good, I mean the numbers are equal in proportion.
So the accuracy which the stacking model gave us was 0.45.",High"You said looking at the data window it will go over overfitting.
How?","We were liking rows.
The rows count was very, very small.
Like suppose let's say if I am a model, I am looking at data.
I'll just look one.
There are less number of fabric entities in that.
So I'll say that for this column, I might think that I might overthink that, this should be the answer for this because it haven't gone through complete numerous number of data points through the values.
By seeing that only to think that over, this should be the answer and for the test data, it might clearly judge upon the previous things.",Medium"So can you please now with whatever you have explained?
Can you tell me what is the cause for overfitting?
What is the cause for overfitting?","Low bias, high variance.
The high variance.",MediumWhat is bias and what is variance?,"Okay.
Bias is when the data is coming from whatever source, whether is it pre-tuned to some set of instances that is called the data is biased.
I am not explaining it to you properly, but this is what I am trying to tell you from what",Mediumhow do you measure it?,How do I measure bias?,High"Because you said low bias, high variance right.","Okay, you can neglect the bias, high variance.",High"Okay, what is variance?","Okay, from the data points which we see in the columns, from one measure to the other measure, that is the variance in what is the movement of the difference between both of the means is called variance.","So if that variance is high, then it is overfitting.","Cumulative variance is high, then it will overfitting.",MediumWhat is cumulative variance?,Basically  sum,Lowsum of what?,All the variances.,Low"What do you mean by all the variances?
How many variances are there?","I mean like from column one to column two on variance, from this to this one variance,",Medium"sum total variances across features.
If it is high, then it is overfitting.",That is what I am thinking.,NASo how do you reduce variance?,"How do we reduce variance?
Maybe by normalizing, maybe by scaling them to a proper level or clamp the range.",Low"So if you scale it down to a smaller range, variance reduces.","It won't  right.
Okay, I will come back to the previous question.
How is the variance clearing overfitting?
How are we reducing the variance?
You are actually doing the parameter tuelling, sir.
For the model to actually get the correct parameters.",Medium"Okay, so how will they reduce the variance?","They will not reduce the variance.
I am not answering that.
I have in my mind, my scaling down, it should reduce variance, sir.",Medium"Okay, then you have a miracle solution.
You just scaled down the grata.
Instead of taking it from 0 to whatever thing, you just put it from 0 to 1 or maybe 0 to 0 to 0.
You variance goes drastically down.
So your overfitting is over.","No, that is. No.",NAThen we should never encounter overfitting right.,"Correct.
I know that is wrong, sir.
It should not.",NA"But there is your answer, only.",How are we pulling on variance?,High"Okay  what is the  effect of high-dimensional, data will lead to overfitting.                                          Did  you say that?",yes I did say that.,NA"Okay.
Tell me what are different encodings we have?","One hot encoding, label encoding.",HighWhat are the difference between them?,"Okay.
So, I will first start with label encoding.
Okay.
Label encoding basically assigns a relationship and then basically assigns 0, 1, 2, 3 numbers to whatever we have.
Suppose we have three categorical values.
It will start by telling 0, 1, 2, 3 through a precedence, telling that this has some greater efficiency.
I mean greater value in that relation set or not.
Whereas one hot encoding puts all others as 0 and the which one has its value, puts that as 1.",High"So, basically label encoding generates a scalar value and one hot encoding generates a vector.",Yes.,NA"When you generate a vector out of a value, does the dimensionality increase or decrease?",It will increase.,NA"So, that will lead to more overfitting.","That...
Yes.",NA"So, it is always detrimental process.",Yes.,NAThen why are people using one hot encoding?,"We should not use one hot encoding, sir.",High"Okay.
Then what should we use?","Use target based encoding, sir.",HighWhat is that?,"Based on our outcome feature, we define the categorical values based on our output feature.
What is a target feature?
By that, we will use... We convert this categorical values into a neumeric.",MediumYou are doing that in your project?,"We don't have any categorical values, sir.
In our project",HighWhat is your project?,That is given to us from the NLP team by performing Robata and Bert Embedings on our data set.,High"If you don't do the Embedings, what will happen?","If we don't do the Embedings, what will happen?
We should do some sort of encoding, sir.
Without encoding…",Low"You suggested a beautiful encoding, right?",sir,NA"You suggested a beautiful encoding, which will reduce dimensionality.
You could have done that.","Yes.
We could have done that.",NAWhy are you not doing it?,But I think the target based encoding will mislead when the text data is huge.,High"What do you mean by huge?
How do you quantify huge?","Basically, if you mean one-hot encoding, then you can define huge because of aact ape, but here, no... …clue sir.",LowHow did the course go for you?,"It was very good, sir.
Project made me learn more.
more the project was the best part I would say",Mediumokay and what is your feedback on me,you are extraordinary sir there is no doubt about that you are,Highwhy you have sent or no I think it is taken care of it right, no I was absent absent in first evaluation also,NA,can I leave thank you thank you sir,NAso MR.Aditya what should I ask you?,Sir you can ask from KNN,MediumOnly from KNN?,I had some idea in linear regression.,MediumKNN and linear regression?,Yes sir.,NASo between these two which one will you prefer?,I prefer KNN,High"Okay, let's deal with KNN.Is KNN a supervised learning algorithm or unsupervised learning algorithm?","Supervised learning algorithm, sir.",HighWhat do you learn during KNN learning?,"KNN means, K  bring points at the data points.",Low"Yeah, but what do you learn there?",Means to find the nearest neighbor beside the data point.,Low"That you do during testing time, right? Without a test pattern, can you find nearby neighbors?",yes sir we can find the euclidean distance,Medium Okay. You can find the neighbors.,Yes.,NA"After you find the neighbors, what do you do?","Means we find the neighbors. , we sort  the distances then we find the…
Depends on the value of k. If the k value is 3, so we find 3 distances.
Maximum distances between those points.",MediumCan you write the formula for Euclidean distance?,"Yes sir.
In n dimensional space.
Sir, just to basic formula for Euclidian
Euclidean means order 2",Low"Is that formula right?
Can you find one fault with that formula which you have written?
What is wrong in the formula which you have written?",Modulus of…..,Lowis there a modulus in Euclidean distance?,"No sir, then Manhattan it will be modulus.",High"Correct.
okay
So, you find the neighbors.",yes sir,NA"K neighbors.
Then what do you do?","Means, by finding we can predict near this point, near this data point is accurate.",LowHow?,"Means, by using this formula",LowBy using this formula,yes sir.,NAWhen does underfitting happen in KNN?,underfitting happens if the K-Value is too much large.,HighWhy?,"Means, overfitting is a condition where, sorry, underfitting is a condition where, sorry, 
 underfitting is a condition where bias value will be high and variance, where variance value can be lower, higher, sir.
If K-Value is high, there will be more number of K points, so it may lead to underfitting.",Low"Yeah, the question is why?",NA,NA"How is KNN affected by the dimensionality of data?
The vector dimension.
How does it affect KNN?",dont know sir,NAWhat is the effect of normalization on KNN?,"So, normalization is one of the process.
It can be used to reduce outliers in present in the particular feature in that dataset.
So, if we are using K-Points in that particular feature, it will make K-Value to be easier.
Means, normalization also not scaling.
If there are more larger values in that particular feature, it will scale that value to lower, so that we can find K-Value easier.",Low"How? Just by scaling the data, how does it become easier?","Since we reduce the values, we can find K-N number of points easily also at that particular data point.",High"You can find K-Points even without normalizing, right?","Yes, sir",NA"So, how does normalization help you?","It means, it reduces the value, sir.",HighYes.,But which can be calculation will be more easier in addition to it.,Low"How?
That is what I am asking.
How can you say that the calculation becomes easier just by reducing the value?",no idea,NAYou know what is accuracy?,"Accuracy is one of the metric measures.
Accuracy is one of the metric measures, which can be used for any confusion matrix.
So, accuracy is equal to 2 positive plus 2 negative 2 positive plus 2 negative plus false positive plus false negative.",LowWhat is the problem with this accuracy measure?,"Sometimes, accuracy cannot means exactly predicted values, means actual value, they can be loss of error, sir.",Lowhow did the course go for you ,I should have put more effort,Highany feedback for me?,no sir,NAthank you very much ,thank you sir,NAWhat is your project?,"My project, it's like when there are multiple solutions for a same question, multiple codes for a same question.
Like we see if the clustering of the codes, when the structure of the code is also different, we see the logic can make clusters.
It's useful for evaluating codes.
The question is same, but there are different codes.",MediumSo how did you use that code for doing clustering?,"So first, what we did is, first we created embeddings for the codes.
We use codify and codbert.
codify plus and codbert.
And after we evaluated both codify and codbert.
And after finding the embeddings, we did the dimensional reduction using UMAP.
And TC TSNE.
So after doing this thing, we did clustering using k-means and DBSCAN.
And we found out that DBSCAN, we got more clusters.
The k-means, it was given only like 5, 4, 5 clusters.
But whereas we have like 30 questions.
For DBSCAN, we got around 24 clusters using UMA.
And using TCN, we got only 21 clusters.",MediumSo what does it mean?,"Till whatever we have evaluated, we found UMA to be best for our dataset.
And DBSAN for clustering is the best for our dataset compared to k-means.",HighBut why did you have to do embedding?,"The codes are like, if the logic is same, we get the embeddings right?
So if the logic is same, they have the same embeddings.",Low"the logic is same, they have the same embedding.
How do you know?",NA,NAWhat are the different performance matrics we use for clustering?,"Accuracy, precision, make, or f1- score?",MediumRegression?,"Root means square, mean square, mean absolute percentage error. R square.",Highis R-square affected by dimensionality.,"no ,Like R-sqaure it just says how the independent variables are explaining the variance in the dependent variable. So, dimensionality.....",Low"Is it affected by normalization of the dataset?
What are the normalization techniques you know?
",Minmax and Z-Score.,Medium"So this Normalization which you do either with minmax or Z-score.
normalization  affect your R square.",no,NAlike why not ,"Like, the variance, no no, the variance changes",Low"Don't get tense, think and answer.
Do you know the variance for R square?
Do you know the formula for R-Square?","yes , I do ",NA"write it 
So tell me how the normaliztion affects this formula.","No, it doesn't. effect.",Medium"Sure.
100% sure.
Confident.
Why you are so confident?","Because normalization, it brings everything to a closer range.
It just doesn't matter here.",HighWhy you say it doesn't matter here?,"Because you are using this thing is, same, like the actual and predicted thing.
The mean, it changes.
Mean the yea it affects",Low"Are you sure?
Are you using the mean anywhere?","Yeah, we are using the mean of the actual...",Low"When we do normalization, where we do normalization?",For the data,LowWhich data?,Independent data.,LowIs this independent variable?,"Yeah, this is the actual... No, no.
This... Yeah, this is the independent variable",LowSure. Why is the independent variable?,This is the actual one.,Highactual  yes ,"No, this is dependent because this is the predicted one.",HighCorrect.,"This is dependent, so it's not affected. Normalization doesn't effect.",Low"So, within two minutes you have generated the answer for it.","Yeah, this normalization doesn't affect because this is not the independent variable",Low"Sure.
100%.
Confident.
You won't change your answer anymore.",no,NA"Very good.
What are different encodings you have?",Label encoding one hot encoding.,HighDoes it affect this?,No.,NAWhich kind of encoding ,"Encoding, so you use them for categorical data?
This is for continuous data.",MediumThat is for input variables or output variables?,Output.,HighSure.,yeah,NAWe do encoding for output variables not input .,Yeah.,NAThink again.,"Yeah, we do it for output data because if the output is ESR, we encode it to 1 and 0.
No, we do it for input data.",Low Changing your answer again.,"Because we have to put that… No, no, input data.",Lowdoes type of encoding have any effect on your R-Square,"input data , no ,no..",NAHow did that course go for you?,good,NAany feed back for me?,nothing,NAthank you very much,thank you sir,NAWhat is your project?,"My project is based on regression which is identifying the understanding the relevance of answer to a question.
So we have assigned marks between 0 to 5 and we have trained on first thought mam gave a data set.
We trained on it and then we did a testing data set and testing data set was made by us.
We used 9 different models K- NN. So I don't remember all the models right now.",MediumWhy do you think regression is the right group of models to be used for your problem?,So our mam is suggested us to do regression.,Medium"Yeah she suggested.
Maybe she might have guessed it.",Because our data more deals with marks so regression is better when dealing with continuous numerical values.,Medium"That is the answer.
Why are you telling mam to do this?

Can you give me one more problem statement for which regression can be used?","Maybe prizes of houses.
Based on the size of the houses.",High"Let us say you have built a regression model.
How will you find out the model building has happened properly or not?","So we find the accuracy of model.
So we test on different models and we will.
No no.
The accuracy is usually not used on regression.
We have to find R square value and RMS CMAE.",Low"Can we write the formula for RMS?
That is RMS C formula.","Yeah like this is the error square.
Mean of the error square root of mean of the error square.",LowWhere is mean?,The mean of this one.,"Where is mean calculations?
How do you find mean of data?",One by n. Yes sir.,NAAre you sure?,Yes.,NA"Something is wrong in the formula.
What is missing?
How do you calculate mean of a set of numbers?",Some of all the numbers divided by and number of terms.,HighWhat is the sum?,N itself is the mean.,Low"What is the sum?
Sum is there?",NA,NASo it is root mean square. What does it tell you?,"So it tells like...
So how the predicted value, how it is the predicted value is differentiating with the actual value?
",MediumThat is what RMS is telling. What is the range of values RMS is can take?,"0 to 1.
0 to 1.
It can be negative as well.",Medium"Negative.
Can you tell me one situation where RMS is can be negative?",When there is overfitting.,"How do you know whether it is overfitting or not?
RMS is the terms negative.
If RMS is negative, then it is overfitting.",Yes sir.,NAOkay. Make sense. And you have heard of normalization of data?,"Yes, sir.
So normalization is like... Like making the data set within a range.
So that it is easier for further analysis.
So it can be done in two ways.
Mid-Max normalization and Z score.
So Z score is more like it finds how distributed it is from the mean, how the data points are distributed, how far it is from the mean.
And min max basically range is between 0 to 1.",MediumWhat is the encoding?,"Like if we have like a categorical data set and we assign value for each value, for each, for each data.
For example, we have a name of the fruits, apple, mango, orange.
And we assign apple as 0, mango as 1 and orange as 2.
That is encoding.",HighWhat are the different types of encodings are there?,Encoding can be done in using one hot encoding and label encoding.,High"If you do one hot encoding, what happens to that data dimentionality?
",It increases.,MediumWhat does that affect your RMS calculation?,"Dimensionality.
I mean the calculation will be more complex.
So it might give a bigger value.",HighWhy will the calculation be more complex?,"Because the dimensionality increases, the calculation can become complex.",High"Which part of the calculation of RMS will become complex?
You have the formula in front of you.
Tell me in the formula which one becomes more complex?","Dimensionality.
The mean.
The predicted and actual value like the one being any difference.
I'm not sure if it becomes complex.",MediumSo you want to take your statement back.,Yes.,NA"Okay, let me repeat that question.
What will happen to your RMS calculation if the dimensionality is not there?","The dimensionality increases.
It will be the same.",High"Very good.
See, you know all the answer.
You are just trying to remember from what you have studied.
And then I said you will get the answer properly.
Very good.
Wonderful
How did the course go for you?",Sir.,NAHow did the course go for you?,"It went well.
It was an interesting subject.
It was nice learning how training, testing works and how to find predictions.",MediumWhat is your feedback for me?,"Sir, your teaching was good.
Till now we had a lot of ups and downs in teaching but in this subject we have a good knowledge on theory.",MediumThank you very much.,Thank you.,NAYou are welcome.,Thank you sir.,NATell me the name of one supervised learning algorithm.,K NN.,NAWhy is it called supervised learning?,"Because we are already using hyper-perparameter of K and distances.
And also in supervised learning it is already classified no sir
We call it K NN. Supervised learning.",MediumWhat is your unsupervised learning?,Unsupervised learning is...  Forgot sir,LowHow do we reduce dimensionality?,By using level encoding the convenience of the reduced dimensionality.,LowWhat is label encoding?,"Lablel encoding instead of using MISU-DOS like 0-1, we level in the class.
Like 1-3-4-5.
We have a week.
If we have week, we put one Monday as 1.
Just day or still like the P-levels.",MediumHow does that help you reduce dimensionality?,I don't know.,NAWe have heard of what are called curses dimensionality.,Sir.,NA"Curses dimensionality.
What is the difference between bagging and boosting?","In boosting, when we have...
In bagging the probabilities of the... Probabilities are same.
When we are boosting, when...
When we are bagging, the probabilities of all are same.
But when in boosting, which are not taken in bagging, we take again and the probability of changes when we are not taken.",LowWhat probability changes?,The... Observations.,Low"Probability of observations change in boosting.
Can you name one boosting classifier?
Regression?","Sir, I only...
I am only... Ungould unto you.
Confusion matrix.
Only good up to confusion matrix.",Low"Okay, can you draw confusion matrix for a multi-class classifier?
Let's say there are 3 classes.
How will this confusion matrix look like?","Sir, I only  to put 2 classes.",Low"Okay, do it for 2 classes.
35 of 50... 35 of 50 identified oranges are actual oranges.
What is the precision?","Out of 50 classified oranges, 35 are correct.",HighWhat is the precision?,That is 35 correct sir.,HighWhat is recall?,That recall is… True positive by true positive plus true negatives.,High"Calculate recall for this.
",I don't know.,NAWhat is Mean?,"Sir, the middlemost value is the outlier, then the median can be outlier, whereas in mean there will be no outliers, there will only single value.
Instead of the choose of one value, in mean we have result all things.",MediumHow do you find if the two vectors are independent of each other?,By doing cosine similality.,HighHow do you do cosine similarity?,"So, I know formula.",Medium"So, what is a dot b?","A dot b is the sum of the vectors.
Addition, so summing the first respective vectors and adding them.",MediumCan you write the formula for a dot d b?,"sir can I take example.
So, if these are two vectors, we find the end of the list.",LowHow?,We multiply these two in and say.,LowCan you put that into a formula?,(Written),NA"Very good.
How did the course go for you?",It is fine.,NAAny feedback from me?,"Sir, feedback for you.
There was nothing sir.
Like, you were the most senior faculty in the university.
We felt good.
Like, yeah, until this time we didn't have this senior faculty and you tell good with examples.
You include examples so that we understood easily.",MediumThank you.,"Thank you, sir",NAwhat have you  prepared for viva ,before midsem,NASo what are you doing after midsem,….........,NA"exam not there so no need to study , is that",no sir,NAHow do you calculate rank of mathematics?,rank of a matrix ?,Highhmm,Taking number of number of  row,LowHow do you find how many numbers of rows are there?,"by doing… ah,
by making each number of numbers.
Each column number is 0.",Loweach element zero,Hmm..,NAis that what you are saying ,NA,NAWhat are the relations between rank of the matrix and,NA,NAthe vector space representation of the data?,NA,NAWhat is the mean and variance of the data after you do normalization,decreases sir ,Mediumdecreses to what,NA,NAyes please,half the value it will decrease,Mediumhow did you come to the value half ,Hmm….,NAwhat is diffrence between Mape and Mae,….....(no answer),NAWhat is the difference between precision and recall?,sir like formula can I say .recall has a really false,Lowhow do you fill the missing values,"doing K-NN , comparing to near value",Medium"what  is Knn ,  how does Knn work ?",find most ah… most repeated value in range of K,Mediumwhat is K,random value… you will take it and put in the algorithm for knn.,Lowok ,"like 3,4,5 so on.That's it sir.",Lowany feedback on  course ,no sir,NAany feedback for me ?,no sir,NAthank  you very much,thank you sir ,NA
